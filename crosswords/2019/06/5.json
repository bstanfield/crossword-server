Nice touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1989, Kazuo Ishiguro won the Booker Prize for his novel <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31c4aKa\"><em>The Remains of the Day</em></a>. Oh, right, he later won this other thing &mdash; the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many people, I read that book and then wondered what else this wonderfully restrained and understated British novelist had written, so I turned to <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WkzJlY\">Never Let Me Go</a></em>. The clue at 19 Across calls it &quot;dystopian&quot; and it&#39;s certainly that. It&#39;s also about as far from <em>Remains </em>stylistically and thematically as you can get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both books are well worth reading and both were adapted for film. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson were among eight Oscar nominees for Remains. Never Let Me Go was a much less successful film. Stick to the book on that one.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=6/5/2019","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["A","C","T","S",".","Q","V","C",".",".","B","R","E","A","D","T","A","R","E",".","U","A","E",".","O","R","A","C","L","E","O","V","E","R","F","I","L","L",".","N","O","D","O","F","F","N","E","V","E","R","L","E","T","M","E","G","O",".",".",".","C","R","O","N","U","T","S",".","C","H","A","N","T","E","D","E","N","R","A","G","E",".","A","G","I","N",".","A","P","R",".",".",".","D","A","D","A","A","R","T",".","L","I","E","U","L","A","P","E","L",".","B","R","A",".","P","E","L","E","G","A","C","I","D",".","S","L","O","W","J","A","M",".",".",".","N","R","A",".","I","T","A","N",".","D","R","O","I","T","S","D","E","F","A","C","E","R",".","O","P","E","N","S","E","A",".",".",".","S","E","V","E","N","W","O","N","D","E","R","S","L","A","D","Y","D","I",".","Y","E","W","T","R","E","E","S","A","M","E","L","I","E",".","U","T","E",".","O","I","S","E","W","O","M","A","N",".",".","K","O","R",".","P","T","A","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,0,0,8,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,24,25,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,32,33,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,43,44,45,46,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,52,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
