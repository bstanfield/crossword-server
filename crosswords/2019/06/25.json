Your level of joy is hugely influenced by the intersection of things in the puzzle and things you love. That Venn Diagram overlap is enormous for me today, so it&#39;s impossible to be objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>I got to feel smug. As soon as I saw all those dots, I guessed we were heading toward a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sunday_Afternoon_on_the_Island_of_La_Grande_Jatte\">Seurat</a> theme.</li>\r\n\t<li>I happen to love the Art Institute of Chicago, home of the iconic painting you discover by connecting the dots.</li>\r\n\t<li>I happen to love Sondheim, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ducG55pfCMQ\"><em>Sunday in the Park with George</em></a> is one of his masterpieces. That musical is centered on that painter and that painting. (If you prefer, you can think of the artwork as a key element in a different kind of iconic scene from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubpRcZNJAnE\"><em>Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</em></a>.)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossword commentators sometimes ding puzzles because they either don&#39;t know or don&#39;t care about the theme.
