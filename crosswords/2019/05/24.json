Of course, I mean the 1937 version with Ronald Colman and Madeleine Carroll. There are several other film versions including two previous ones from the silent film era and a near shot-for-shot color remake in 1952 starring Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr, and James Mason. The Colman version is best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is, crossword solving is personal, and a single answer that happens to spark joy, even for tangential reasons, can elevate the whole experience. I enjoyed today&#39;s puzzle far more than Jeff did. &quot;We are, in fact, amused.&quot;</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=5/24/2019","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":[".","S","L","A","P","D","A","S","H",".","H","O","A","R","D","S","T","A","R","E","I","N","T","O",".","E","D","G","E","R","L","E","N","D","A","N","E","A","R",".","L","I","N","D","Y","A","L","D","O",".","T","W","I","N",".","D","E","U","C","E","S","M","A","R","M",".",".","N","E","W","T",".","S","H","Y","H","O","U","S","E","M","D",".",".","R","O","A","D","I","E",".",".",".",".","M","A","I","T","A","I",".","P","E","N","D",".","Q","U","E","E","N","V","I","C","T","O","R","I","A",".","O","U","S","T",".","T","E","X","T","E","D",".",".",".",".","P","A","S","C","A","L",".",".","E","R","E","A","D","E","R","E","T","E",".","G","E","A","R",".",".","S","L","O","M","O","N","O","N","C","E",".","B","E","T","S",".","P","R","A","Y","B","R","A","U","N",".","R","U","R","I","T","A","N","I","A","A","Z","T","E","C",".","A","S","I","R","E","C","A","L","L","R","E","E","D","Y",".","M","E","X","I","C","A","N","S","."],"gridnums":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,22,0,0,23,0,24,0,0,25,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,27,28,0,0,29,0,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,32,33,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,35,36,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,43,0,0,44,45,46,47,48,0,0,0,49,0,50,51,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,54,0,0,55,0,56,57,0,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
