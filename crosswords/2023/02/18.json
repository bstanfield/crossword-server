{"title":"New York Times, Saturday, February 18, 2023","author":"Kameron Austin Collins","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2023, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"2/18/2023","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who is filming a screwball comedy with IRENE Dunne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect Saturday themeless crosswords to have a few great clues, and we get some doozies today. The top left corner starts with two outstanding ones. [Popular pubs for college grads] for ALUMNI MAGS is brilliant. [Directive for the board] is one of my favorite clue types. I&#39;ve seen DON&#39;T ERASE on blackboards hundreds of times, but not since high school. Clues that bring out memories you didn&#39;t know you had are especially satisfying.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"left\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/DMX.rapper_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-DMX.rapper_%28cropped%29.jpg\" style=\"width:220px\" title=\"Street Prophet DMX\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>I always learn something from this constructor. STREET PROPHETS felt too generic, but in crosswords, phrases like that must be a &quot;thing&quot;, not just a &quot;description.&quot; As you probably already know, it is indeed someone who spreads the gospel through rap music or graffiti. Tupac and DMX are considered prime examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too many &quot;great clues&quot; can make a crossword overly tricky, and this one played hard for me. PHONE RECORDS for [Some damning legal evidence] feels tenuous. Sicily&#39;s ENNA used to be a crossword staple, but it&#39;s rare now. BARBED WIT didn&#39;t come easily to me, so [Art of cutting cards] was confusing, although delightful when the pin dropped. These things are personal, though. Fast solvers will race through this puzzle and be sorry that it&#39;s over so quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s often something in each puzzle that reminds me of a Sondheim lyric, and I&#39;ve learned to keep that annoying habit to myself. Today, though, two different clues point to the same song from &quot;Funny Thing&quot;: the &quot;one two&quot; pun at 57-Across and the &quot;Left right left right&quot; clue at 12 -Down. Imperial Rome Captain Miles Gloriosus leads his troops into town singing:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One, ... Two, ... One, ... Two, ...<br />\r\nWe not only fought but we won, too!<br />\r\nLeft, ... Right, ... Left, ... Right, ...<br />\r\nThere&#39;s none of the enemy left, right?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You didn&#39;t ask, but this month&#39;s <em>Jim Horne Book Club</em> selection is <a class=\"nowrap\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3jTVqqd\">Dr. No.</a> Not the Ian Fleming book, but the recent novel by the brilliant Percival Everett.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=2/18/2023","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"json":true,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["D","O","N","T","E","R","A","S","E",".",".",".","B","B","S","A","L","U","M","N","I","M","A","G","S",".","C","L","A","W","R","I","D","I","N","G","B","O","O","T",".","A","U","R","A","T","V","G",".","A","H","I",".",".","R","A","C","E","B","Y","S","E","E","S",".","T","E","N","D","E","R","A","G","E",".",".",".",".","P","H","O","N","E","R","E","C","O","R","D","S","E","D","G","E","I","N",".","W","E","T",".",".","A","W","E","L","E","A","D","E","R","S",".","A","P","H","A","S","I","A","A","C","L",".",".","I","O","N",".","R","O","U","S","T","S","H","A","V","E","A","G","O","O","D","O","N","E",".",".",".",".","D","E","A","T","H","T","R","A","P",".","L","I","F","T","S","E","S","T","E","T",".",".","P","H","D",".","R","O","O","U","N","T","O",".","O","N","T","H","E","A","L","E","R","T","I","C","O","N",".","N","O","E","N","T","R","A","N","C","E","T","E","N",".",".",".","B","E","E","S","K","N","E","E","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,0,0,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,15,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,23,0,24,0,25,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,30,31,32,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,36,0,37,0,38,39,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,41,0,42,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,45,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49,50,51,52,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,54,0,55,0,56,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,58,59,60,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
