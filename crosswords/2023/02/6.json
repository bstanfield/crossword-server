G-flat major is far more common, it&#39;s identical (at least for keyboard players), it&#39;s slightly easier to notate, and it&#39;s a favorite for many pianists, including me. There are philosophical differences between the two essentially identical keys that matter greatly to some people. Some classical composers, including Bach and Chopin preferred F-sharp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Great American Songwriter Irving Berlin famously could only play in only one key: F-sharp major! He had a special piano built so he could transpose to other keys by manipulating a lever that shifted the whole keyboard lower or higher.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Monday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=2/6/2023","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"json":true,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["C","L","A","W","S",".","S","O","B","S",".","P","E","A","K","L","I","M","I","T",".","Q","T","I","P",".","E","A","S","E","I","V","A","N","A",".","U","R","G","E",".","P","R","E","Y","F","E","Z",".","S","H","I","A",".","A","K","I","T","A","S","F","R","E","S","H","E","R",".","W","R","A","T","H",".",".",".",".",".","S","E","A","M",".","A","T","L","A","R","G","E","G","R","I","N","D","R",".","A","C","H","E",".","I","U","D","O","O","H","S",".","T","E","N","O","R",".","A","S","T","I","B","A","E",".","S","H","A","G",".","O","D","D","E","S","T","S","M","A","R","T","E","R",".","A","W","E","D",".",".",".",".",".","R","O","Y","A","L",".","M","E","A","S","U","R","E","M","A","T","T","E","L",".","P","U","R","R",".","P","E","R","O","H","H","I",".","T","R","E","S",".","G","I","T","M","O","O","M","A","N",".","H","I","R","E",".","O","V","O","I","D","N","E","T","I",".","Y","A","M","S",".","D","E","N","T","E"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,22,0,0,0,23,24,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,31,32,33,34,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,39,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,43,44,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,50,51,52,53,54,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,58,59,0,0,0,60,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0],"circles":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
