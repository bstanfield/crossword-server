{"title":"Movin&#39; On Up","author":"Christina Iverson and Scott Hogan","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"7/10/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who is ROFL.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072431/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/m9vq2erfrd971.png\" style=\"width:280px\" title=\"Crossword-friendly Teri Garr as lab assistant INGA\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunday NYT puzzles have titles. (With rare <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/3/2015\">exceptions</a>, other days do not.) Sometimes the title gives away the trick, and for that reason, many solvers avert their eyes. Today, I was able to guess the gimmick from the title alone. Fortunately, I guessed wrong, and the real trick is more fun than just shifting ON within a word. Here&#39;s how it works:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>In the bottom half of the grid, common phrases have their terminal ONs expurgated.</li>\r\n\t<li>Following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass\">Conservation laws</a>, those ONs have to go somewhere. They float up to the ends of the answers immediately above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These theme types work best when the modifications completely change the meaning of the base text, and that&#39;s where this puzzle shines. 3-Down transmogrifies BAT to BATON. That ON was stolen from SEASON in the answer below. Oh, Cap&#39;n, &#39;TIS THE SEAS is the perfect answer to &quot;Why art thou queasy?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entertaining themes only get you so far on a big Sunday crossword. You also need a sprinkling of outstanding clues.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&quot;God whose name sounds like the ammunition he uses&quot; is Eros (aka, Cupid) whose ammunition (!) is ARROWS. Do they sound the same? Very close!</li>\r\n\t<li>&quot;Takes a car, in a way.&quot; In a way gets us thinking that this must be either something about REPO or maybe GRAND THEFT AUTO. Wrong. When one UBERS, one takes a car. I love clues that I know I could never have thought up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the second recent puzzle where a <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=6/26/2022&amp;g=28&amp;d=A\">word got transformed into COUP</a>. Perhaps the next one will run on January 6.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Sunday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/10/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":true,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":21,"cols":21},"grid":["R","O","F","L",".","A","W","E","D",".","T","R","E","A","T",".","T","E","M","P","T","O","U","R","S",".","C","A","L","E",".","R","A","S","T","A",".","A","N","A","I","S","S","T","U","D","F","A","R","M","S",".","A","Z","T","E","C",".","B","R","I","N","K","A","R","I",".","L","I","M","I","T",".","S","E","E",".","O","O","L","O","N","G","S",".","O","T","H","O",".","U","R","I","A","H",".","R","E","B","R","A","N","D",".",".",".",".","B","A","S",".","P","A","N","I","C",".",".","B","A","D",".",".","R","I","P","T","E","A","R","S","A","T",".","E","D","A","M",".","B","R","O","U","H","A","H","A","A","R","T","D","E","C","O",".","D","E","N","I","M",".","O","C","T","A","G","O","N","D","O","O","R","S","T","O","P",".","S","O","L","E","M","N",".","E","L","O","P","E","S","S","N",".",".","S","N","U","G",".","N","A","T","O",".","C","R","O","N","E","S",".",".",".","S","T","U",".","R","I","B",".","N","O","T",".","H","I","S",".",".",".","C","A","T","N","A","P",".","G","A","R","B",".","O","H","H","I",".",".","W","A","S","A","R","I","A","L",".","S","E","N","I","O","R",".","S","E","N","D","H","E","L","P","R","E","S","P","E","C","T",".","T","A","X","E","D",".","A","U","R","E","L","I","A","L","A","T","E","S","H","O","W",".","R","I","T","A",".","R","A","I","L","C","A","R","A","S","H",".",".","I","R","A",".",".","N","I","G","H","T",".","F","L","O",".",".",".",".","E","V","I","L","E","Y","E",".","G","E","N","U","S",".","T","O","M","B",".","H","A","S","I","D","I","C",".","A","W","L",".","A","M","U","S","E",".","E","A","U","O","R","E","O","S",".","O","H","G","E","E",".","B","A","R","C","R","A","W","L","S","S","C","A","L","A",".","U","B","E","R","S",".","I","N","G","A",".","C","A","S","E","E","S","S","A","Y",".","P","O","R","E","S",".","T","E","E","D",".","E","G","A","D"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,14,15,16,17,18,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,30,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,33,0,0,34,0,0,35,0,0,36,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,41,42,43,44,45,0,0,0,46,0,0,47,0,0,48,0,49,0,0,50,51,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,54,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,63,0,64,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,67,0,0,68,0,69,0,70,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,0,72,73,74,0,0,0,0,75,0,0,76,0,77,0,78,0,0,0,79,80,81,82,0,0,0,0,0,83,0,0,0,0,84,0,85,0,0,86,87,0,0,0,88,0,0,0,0,89,0,0,90,0,0,0,91,0,92,0,0,0,0,0,0,93,0,0,0,0,0,0,94,0,95,0,0,0,0,96,0,0,0,0,0,0,97,0,0,0,0,98,0,0,0,0,99,0,0,100,0,0,101,0,0,0,0,0,0,102,103,104,0,0,0,105,0,106,0,0,0,0,0,107,0,0,108,0,109,110,0,0,0,0,0,0,111,112,0,0,113,0,0,114,0,0,115,0,116,117,0,0,0,0,0,118,119,0,0,0,0,120,0,0,0,0,121,0,0,0,122,0,0,0,0,0,123,0,0,0,0,0,124,0,0,0,0,125,0,0,0,126,0,0,0,0,0,127,0,0,0,0,0,128,0,0,0,0,129,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1. ðŸ˜‚","5.
