Like <a href=\"https://bemoresmarter.com/\">Lollapuzzoola</a> (August 27) or <a href=\"https://www.crosswordtournament.com/\">ACPT</a> (next March 31 to April 2), they have great puzzles from excellent constructors, but they stand out by having several tournaments a year and for absolutely nailing the online experience. This year you can participate virtually or in person, alone or in pairs. <a href=\"https://www.boswords.org/\">The summer tournament is tomorrow, July 24</a>. Not sure if you should jump in? Go for it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have alternating current at our electrical sockets today because TESLA outmaneuvered Edison, who advocated for direct current. The consequences have shaped how electronics work ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marion COTILLARD is an outstanding talent with equal success in both her native French and in English. Keep an eye on her. DAR es Salaam (or just DAR) is the largest city in Tanzania. LEES is an old word for the sediment at the bottom of a wine barrel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slang in crosswords is controversial, AM I RITE?
