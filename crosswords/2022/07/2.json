As the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXi3bjKowJU\">Inchworm song</a> reminds us, two and two ARE (make) four. Here are some more that remind you that you&#39;re working on a late-week themeless:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SEC: Tick or tock</li>\r\n\t<li>EAT: Verb whose past tense form is an anagram of its present tense</li>\r\n\t<li>ACE: Game 1 starter, typically (oh, it&#39;s baseball!)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are some less famous names:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ALI: Tony-winning actress Stroker</li>\r\n\t<li>SAL: Comedian Vulcano of &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And some misdirections:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>USB: Port letters (not VSOP or some such)</li>\r\n\t<li>HAT: Hi-___ (not RES)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>ROE is clued carefully these days to avoid sensitive political associations. Fortunately, it&#39;s Saturday, so we can get away with &quot;Tobiko or masago.&quot; (You got that one right away? Well, fine.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TANKINI combines a tank top and a bikini bottom. You get the modesty of a one-piece, but you don&#39;t have to remove your entire swimsuit to use the toilet.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/2/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["T","H","E","S","C","R","E","A","M",".","P","A","T","I","O","H","E","X","A","H","E","D","R","A",".","S","L","A","S","H","W","A","L","L","A","B","I","E","S",".","S","I","N","A","I","A","D","O",".","N","U","T",".","T","A","T",".","K","I","T","C","I","V","E","T","S",".","G","E","L",".","B","I","D","S","K","N","E","W",".",".","T","U","R","K",".","A","N","N","O",".","G","R","E","A","T","R","E","C","E","S","S","I","O","N",".",".",".",".","T","H","I","S","O","N","E",".",".",".",".","N","E","T","F","L","I","X","S","P","E","C","I","A","L",".","O","R","A","L",".","G","R","A","Y",".",".","P","S","A","S","S","E","X","Y",".","H","A","T",".","D","R","A","T","C","H","E","A","T",".","U","S","B",".","F","E","E",".","R","O","E","A","D","I","O","S",".","B","A","L","L","E","R","I","N","A","R","E","M","A","P",".","I","C","A","L","L","E","D","I","T","T","R","E","K","S",".","T","E","X","A","S","T","E","C","H"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,22,0,0,23,0,0,24,0,0,25,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,32,33,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,37,38,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,41,42,0,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,46,47,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,49,50,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,54,0,0,55,0,0,56,0,0,57,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
