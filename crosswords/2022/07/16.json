You&#39;ll find a BIO on a <em>book</em> jacket. (Kindle users can look up &quot;book jacket&quot; on the Internet. It used to be a thing.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I should have guessed it had nothing to do with that former model. Kameron Austin Collins is a conscientious constructor who wants entries that reflect his personality, his experiences, his taste, his values. Crosswords is a game but, for better or worse, it&#39;s seen by many as outlining which areas of knowledge are important, and even what might be worthy of celebration. Crosswords should be Funshine, not yucky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, DOG SLOBBER is yucky, but affectionate yucky. DEAR OLD DAD, DREAM LOVER, and CARE BEARS contribute more warmth. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth\">THOTH</a> looks creepy, but I&#39;m sure he was a swell guy. Er, God.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&quot;Emergency device in DC&quot; refers to DC Comics or now, the DC Extended Universe.</li>\r\n\t<li>&quot;Salome&quot; is the go-to play or opera for &quot;one-act&quot;, just like Beethoven&#39;s 6th is the de facto crossword clue for IN F.</li>\r\n\t<li>1-Across reminds me of that jokey answer to Lewis Carroll&#39;s &quot;Why is a raven like a writing desk?&quot; Because Poe wrote on both. DESK fit &quot;something you might write on&quot; but not for long.</li>\r\n\t<li>Crossword constructors often consult Google NGRAMS to determine the popularity or relative usage frequencies of words or phrases.
