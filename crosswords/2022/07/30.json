{"title":"New York Times, Saturday, July 30, 2022","author":"Lance Enfinger","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"7/30/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who is hawking CURE-ALLS at a medicine show.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e1/22/43/e122431a9987cf10aa4ba0769e22d926.jpg\" style=\"width:238px\" title=\"Roary\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s talk ASS. That convenient word has <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=ASS\">a long history in crosswords</a>, usually referring to a beast of burden or a despicable person &mdash; &quot;Jenny&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, or &quot;Jerk&quot;. Today it&#39;s an intensifier as in, &quot;this is a good ass puzzle.&quot; Hmmm, that doesn&#39;t sound right. You want the puzzle to be <em>bad</em> ass. Apparently that intensifier is also sometimes a reverser. Pro tip: regardless of what you think of your neighbor&#39;s ass, do not covet! It&#39;s a top ten no-no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again&quot; is the famous opening line in Daphne du Maurier&#39;s novel, <em>Rebecca</em>. ENYA should watch her step! Fortunately, it&#39;s not the same place. ENYA renamed her Dublin castle Manderley. That was a popular thing to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love clues like &quot;The N.F.L. mascot Roary, for one.&quot; I have no clue about sports mascots. But yes, I do! The clue is in the clue. Roary is an odd spelling, right? Roary must be a LION.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Candide</em> is sometimes called a musical, but it really is an OPERETTA. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein\" title=\"Leonard Bernstein\">Leonard Bernstein</a> wrote the music, Lyrics are by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wilbur\" title=\"Richard Wilbur\">Richard Wilbur</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_La_Touche_(lyricist)\" title=\"John La Touche (lyricist)\">John Latouche</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Parker\" title=\"Dorothy Parker\">Dorothy Parker</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Hellman\" title=\"Lillian Hellman\">Lillian Hellman</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim\" title=\"Stephen Sondheim\">Stephen Sondheim</a>, and Bernstein himself. That&#39;s quite a list!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surprise for me at 59-Across isn&#39;t in the answer (FRESNO) but in the clue. I would not have guessed that San Francisco is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_in_California_by_population\">ranked as low as 4th in California by population</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &quot;future-altering decision point&quot; is a SLIDING DOOR. You may know that metaphor from the 1998 Gwyneth Paltrow movie. It&#39;s a popular literary trope. The super-hot-now writer Taylor Jenkins Reid used it in her novel <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uX0PPr\">Maybe in Another Life</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a great ass weekend! Er, I mean an atrocious ass weekend. Nope, still sounds wrong. Phat ass weekend? Forget it. Have whatever kind of weekend you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:75.05%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/422-yb8TXj8\"></iframe></div>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/30/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["C","U","R","E","A","L","L","S",".","I","S","P","O","S","E","O","P","E","N","S","E","A","T",".","F","L","I","P","O","N","S","T","A","Y","S","A","N","E",".","S","I","N","E","A","D","M","O","M","A",".","D","A","M","S",".","D","O","R","K","S","O","P","S",".","F","B","I",".","W","H","I","T","E",".",".",".",".",".","M","I","A",".","L","I","O","N",".","T","R","U","I","S","T","I","L","L","D","O","N","T","G","E","T","I","T","T","H","R","E","E","L","E","G","G","E","D","R","A","C","E","C","O","U","N","T","O","N","E","S","L","O","S","S","E","S","H","O","E",".","M","O","O","S",".","C","O","T",".",".",".",".",".","F","L","I","N","T",".","B","A","R",".","M","E","L","C","R","A","I","G",".","E","E","L","S",".","M","E","N","U","H","E","L","L","N","O",".","G","U","I","D","E","D","O","G","E","A","S","T","O","N",".","O","N","N","O","T","I","C","E","F","R","E","S","N","O",".","S","T","O","M","A","C","H","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,21,0,22,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,25,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,30,31,32,33,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,46,47,48,49,0,0,0,0,50,51,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,55,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
