Only PEA-GREEN doesn&#39;t fit. PUTTING GREEN fits &quot;Where golfers practice short strokes&quot; from the set of random Notepad clues, but what does that have to do with either owls or pussycats?</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/seahorse/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://animalfactguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sea_horse_is_horsey-e1609821832721-725x569.jpg\" style=\"width:446px\" title=\"C Horse\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom McCoy is one of the more creative constructors. Click his photo to see his Author Page, select any of his 34 other puzzles, and you&#39;re likely to think, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a gimmick quite like that before.&quot; He&#39;s a deep thinker about math and words, which comes through in his themes. Watch his fascinating video in the notes to <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=3/18/2021\">his previous puzzle</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case today&#39;s theme didn&#39;t click for you, it&#39;s a homophone initialism puzzle. Read PUTTING GREEN as P GREEN, and it sounds right. CHARLEY HORSE (which fits &quot;Leg cramp&quot;) becomes C HORSE which, when sounded out, fits &quot;Fish with a prehensile tail.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sign of cruciverbal professionalism, his long Downs are fun too. LET&#39;S GET ON WITH IT, and WHAT&#39;S YOUR SECRET are outstanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FALSE TRUTH at 53/54 Across is an interesting phrase.
