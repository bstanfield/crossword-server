You may know that he led The Pre-Shortzian Puzzle Project, which is the only reason we have digital versions of pre-1993 NYT crosswords. You might not know that it&#39;s an ongoing concern. We get regular reports from users who spot bugs. An amazing woman named Jane Foley has found hundreds of mistakes, and she&#39;s but one of many who continue to contribute. Each error is then carefully researched by David before being updated here. It&#39;s a huge job, all for the benefit of getting history right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does WHOOPEE CUSHION advance the artform? Pre-Shortz editors would never have used it, but admit it, you smiled. And, yes, David passed a FART right underneath. Kids nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are some &quot;things people do in bars&quot;? Do they RAWR to express appreciation for someone&#39;s level of sexual attraction? I wouldn&#39;t know, but what they do do is SHOTS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe they&#39;re looking for &quot;Latin lovers&quot;? Imagine their surprise when they end up going home with POPES. I hear the bedrooms at the Vatican are RAWR.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/22/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["R","A","W","R",".",".","R","I","C","E",".","E","A","S","T","A","L","O","E",".","L","E","M","O","N","S","A","U","C","E","Y","A","R","D",".","I","T","S","D","O","O","R","D","I","E",".",".","K","H","A","K","I",".",".",".","T","R","I","O","S","W","H","O","O","P","E","E","C","U","S","H","I","O","N",".","H","E","F","T","E","D",".","A","S","P","E","N",".",".",".","A","M","A","S","S",".","B","R","A","I","N","G","A","M","E","M","A","R",".",".","S","L","A","I","N",".",".","H","O","P","O","N","T","H","E","T","O","W","N",".","S","H","O","T","S",".",".",".","O","S","A","K","A",".","P","L","A","Y","T","O",".","W","H","I","T","N","E","Y","H","O","U","S","T","O","N","B","R","A","S","H",".",".",".","O","P","R","A","H",".",".","L","I","S","T","E","N","T","O","M","E",".","F","E","T","A","U","T","T","E","R","B","O","R","E","S",".","I","R","A","N","R","E","E","D",".","A","Y","E","S",".",".","T","E","X","T"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,0,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,22,0,0,0,0,0,23,24,25,0,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,30,31,32,33,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,36,0,0,37,38,0,0,0,0,0,39,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,44,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,49,50,51,0,0,0,52,0,53,54,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
