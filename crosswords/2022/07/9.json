But now I know. Two extraordinary actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossword clues always allow a certain flexibility. &quot;Flexible musical tempos&quot; will consternate purists who insist that &quot;tempos&quot; should be &quot;tempi.&quot; It&#39;s Italian, after all. But that allows the answer RUBATOS to be similarly non-snooty. I mean, it&#39;s the common way many musicians speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, ask any singer what &quot;Voi, che sapete&quot; is, and they&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s an ARIA from Marriage of Figaro. Is it really an ARIETTA (a small aria)? Well, technically. Maybe. I suppose. This precision is the opposite of RUBATOS fuzziness. All&#39;s fair on Saturday. You may already know this tune, even if you don&#39;t recognize the name. If not, Cecilia Bartoli is the perfect singer to introduce you.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:56.29%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mDeFdGzthV0\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Constructor Kevin G. Der knows more about both music and the world than I do, but it was fun to remember that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_of_Jars\">Plain of Jars</a> is in LAOS, and learn that <a href=\"https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-nollywood/\">Nollywood</a> is Nigerian. 2,500 films a year! Lagos isn&#39;t the capital, but it&#39;s the largest city in that country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the &quot;Business of the Dutch East India Company&quot;? I know this one! It&#39;s got to be something about spices or coffee or sugarcane. Oh, it&#39;s SEA TRADE. Generic, but ok. It&#39;s Saturday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HIZZONER? Huh? From <a href=\"https://politicaldictionary.com/words/hizzoner/\">Political Dictionary</a>: &quot;William Safire has said that the term was first popularized during the mayoralty of Fiorello LaGuardia; LaGuardia, as Safire says, was definitely not a formal figure, so a nickname which played with his office&#39;s formal title sat well with him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, here&#39;s one I know for sure. Holden Caulfield&#39;s brother is, uh, D.B. something, right? Not right. He had another brother ALLIE who died before the story even started. Did I mention it&#39;s Saturday?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS for Pool Side: Stripes and SOLIDS are the two sides in the game of pool.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/9/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["C","H","I","C","A",".","C","R","A","F","T","B","R","E","W","L","A","G","O","S",".","L","U","N","A","R","Y","E","A","R","A","B","O","R","T",".","A","B","O","M","I","N","A","T","E","R","A","T","S","O",".","M","A","D","E","M","A","G","I","C","I","N","T","E","R","A","C","T","E","D",".","T","A","N","K","N","E","A","T",".","L","A","O","S",".","L","U","N","G","S","E","R","G",".","E","L","K","S",".","D","O","R",".",".",".","T","O","O","T","S","I","E",".","B","O","N","E","A","S","H",".",".",".","A","P","E",".","G","O","N","G",".","R","E","I","S","I","T","B","Y",".","B","A","D","E",".","D","I","A","Z","O","V","A","L",".","Z","A","Z","I","E","B","E","E","T","Z","L","A","T","E","M","O","D","E","L",".","I","N","T","R","O","I","N","A","T","A","N","G","L","E",".","C","O","T","A","N","D","E","M","O","R","E","E","L","S",".","E","V","A","D","E","S","K","I","P","A","S","S","E","S",".","P","O","S","E","R"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,33,34,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,39,40,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
