{"title":"It&#39;s All On the Table","author":"Greg Slovacek","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"7/17/2022","notepad":"A note on Texas hold’em:\n\nPlayers seek to combine one or more of the cards they hold with cards laid out on the table to make the best possible five-card poker hand.","jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who knows when to hold &#39;em, &amp; etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think I understand this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step one is to figure out there&#39;s a rebus trick going on related to playing cards. Each rebus square has two parts corresponding to the value and suit of a card. The Across answers define the value (TEN, QUEEN, etc.) and the Down answers define the suit (CLUB, HEART, etc.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_Playing_Poker\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Bbmt9kgh9il0XkfmG-LaWAHaFj?pid=ImgDet&amp;rs=1\" style=\"width:467px\" title=\"That's a good boy\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, 1-Down and 8-Down will use the suits. 1-Down [Pop culture sister site of The Onion] refers to the web site <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/\">AV CLUB</a>, and 8-Down [Aplenty] means IN SPADES.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But 22-Across will use the values, so [Plant with clusters of tiny white flowers] is QUEEN ANNE&#39;S LACE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The square at the start of 22-Across will be QUEEN reading across and CLUB reading down, so the card is the Queen of Clubs. Similarly, at the end of 22-Across, it reads ACE going across and SPADE going down, so the card is the Ace of Spades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at the grid. It explains this better than I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Texas hold &#39;em, each player is dealt two cards face down, and then (eventually) five more cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table. (The detailed rules and terminology aren&#39;t important for this puzzle.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four Across answers near the top and bottom with two cards each represent hands dealt to four players sitting around a table. The <strong>top-left</strong> player has a Queen and an Ace. Combining with the center cards nets a pair of each. Two pair isn&#39;t bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>top-right</strong> player has a Two of Hearts and a King of Clubs. Not much going on here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>bottom-left</strong> has an Ace of Clubs and a 10 of Spades. With the center cards, this player gets a Full House &mdash; two Aces and three 10s. Great hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately for the others, the<strong> bottom-right</strong> player has a Jack and King of Hearts. Combining those with a 10, Queen, and Ace of Hearts from the center cards makes a Royal Flush &mdash; the best possible hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, there have been many attempts to combine crosswords with games like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/7/2019\">Chess</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=12/29/2013\">Pool </a>or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/5/2014\">Clue</a> or even <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=3/27/2011\">Bowling</a>. I admire the audacity of this attempt to combine with Poker. It&#39;s a lot of work to figure out that some random squares represent playing cards. Let&#39;s hope you love card games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We&#39;ve been asked how to enter the rebus values into the grids. We&#39;re not the NYT but I took a look at what their code accepts. For the Queen of Clubs, you can enter any of these options: &quot;QUEEN&quot;, &quot;QUEENOFCLUBS&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;CLUB&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;QUEEN/CLUB&quot;, &quot;CLUB/QUEEN&quot;, &quot;Q/C&quot;, or &quot;C/Q&quot;. The easiest would just be either <strong>Q</strong> or <strong>C</strong>, both of which work.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Sunday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/17/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":true,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":21,"cols":21},"grid":["A","M","A","R","E","T","T","I",".",".","L","O","C","H",".",".","S","L","A","B","S","V","E","N","E","T","I","A","N",".","R","E","P","A","I","R",".","A","I","S","L","E","Q♣","A","N","N","E","S","L","A♠",".","E","M","E","R","G","E",".","G","E","T","A","C",".","G","U","T",".","A","E","S","O","P",".","N","E","2♥","R","K♣","E","V","E","N","T","A","A","A","S",".",".",".",".","R","O","A","S","T","H","A","M",".",".","R","K","O","H","I","L","T",".","I","N","H","A","S","T","E",".",".","N","E","R","D","I","E","R","I","N","S","O","M","N","I","A",".",".","T","A","B","U",".","D","O","E","S","T",".",".",".",".",".","I","N","T","U","R","N",".","T","Y","R","A",".","Y","A","K","S",".","A","S","P","E","N",".","S","L","O","E",".",".","10♥","D","S","B","A","R",".",".",".","M","A","R","A","U","D",".","S","M","I","T","10♣",".","U","T","I","L",".","P","E","P","P","L","O","T","T","E","D",".","P","L","A♥","B","O",".","I","N","F","L","A","M","E","S","E","W",".","E","L","A","N",".","7♦","S","E","A","S",".","S","L","A","V","I","C",".",".",".","W","H","I","T","E","Q♥",".",".","R","H","E","A",".","U","B","E","R","S",".","F","O","R","A",".","A","S","H","E",".","S","U","N","U","P","S",".",".",".",".",".","E","V","E","N","S",".","T","S","A","R",".",".","S","N","L","H","O","S","T","S","B","R","E","N","D","A","N",".",".","S","U","B","S","E","T","S",".","P","U","R","E","A","G","R",".",".","M","O","R","T","I","M","E","R",".",".",".",".","E","P","E","E","S","U","R","F","A♣","10♠","S","I","O","N",".","L","O","U","I","S",".","N","R","A",".","I","S","A","A","C",".","I","D","I","G","I","T",".","S","M","O","K♥","J♥","E","T","S","L","O","T","T","A",".","R","E","L","I","C","S",".","E","S","T","E","E","M","E","D","S","N","E","E","R",".",".","R","E","N","E",".",".","R","O","U","N","D","E","R","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,0,9,10,11,12,0,0,13,14,15,16,17,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,26,0,0,27,0,0,28,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,35,36,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,39,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,44,45,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,49,0,50,0,0,51,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,54,55,56,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,62,0,0,63,64,0,65,0,0,0,0,66,67,68,69,0,0,0,0,0,70,0,71,0,0,0,72,0,73,0,0,74,0,0,0,75,0,0,0,76,0,0,77,0,78,0,0,0,79,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,81,0,0,0,0,82,0,0,83,0,0,84,0,85,0,0,0,0,0,86,87,0,0,0,88,0,0,89,0,90,0,0,0,91,0,0,0,0,0,0,92,0,0,0,93,0,94,0,0,95,0,0,96,0,0,0,97,98,99,100,101,0,0,0,0,0,102,0,0,103,0,104,105,0,0,0,0,106,0,0,0,107,0,0,0,0,108,0,109,110,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,111,0,0,0,112,0,0,113,114,0,0,0,0,0,0,115,0,116,117,118,0,119,0,0,0,120,0,0,0,0,0,121,0,0,0,122,0,0,123,0,0,124,0,0,0,125,126,0,0,0,0,0,127,0,0,0,0,0,0,128,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,129,0,0,0,0,0,0,130,0,0,0,0,0,131,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
