{"title":"New York Times, Friday, July 29, 2022","author":"Robyn Weintraub","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"7/29/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Attend the tale of Titus Andronicus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who is unsuccessfully skipping stones. I&#39;m excited (well, excited and scared) to credit Robyn Weintraub for including one of my favorite crossword gimmicks. NYT headline writers are famous for little in-jokes that might include, say, an innocuous near-quote from a musical. They do this knowing only a percentage of the readers will notice but those that do will get a jolt of joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today at 58-Across, we&#39;re asked to remember an obscure Shakespearean gastronomic detail. Well, the detail isn&#39;t obscure, it&#39;s the climax of the story, but the gory play itself is seldom performed and is considered bottom-shelf Bard. The PIES in question are more Mrs. Lovett than Sara Lee. As Lavinia cleans off her plate, she learns that her murdered sons were baked into that tasty meat pie. Yuck, right? But also (maybe) hey, I knew that!</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.cooperstowncred.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ALEX-RODRIGUEZ-MARINERS-NBC-SPORTS.png?w=758&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:513px\" title=\"Alex Rodriguez, aka A-ROD\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A more familiar gimmick is the fake sex reference. You knew &quot;Fun times between the sheets&quot; wasn&#39;t going to be naughty, but it&#39;s an example of the general category of clues that foil your first assumption. &quot;Hall of fame collaborator&quot; has nothing to do with <em>The</em> Hall of Fame. Pay attention to those capital letters! &quot;Lead-in to street name&quot; has nothing to do with names of streets. Slang is fair game. &quot;It looks better with curls&quot; has nothing to do with your own beautiful locks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people assume RIM SHOT (4-Down) is some percussion &quot;flourish&quot; that involves a quick ta-da-dum and a cymbal crash. This is wrong. It&#39;s a single shot with a drumstick that hits the rim and the head of a snare drum simultaneously. I don&#39;t know where that other notion comes from. (If the drummer repeats a rim shot, is there a repercussion?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leviticus 11 does indeed prohibit eating PORK (37-Across), but that barely scratches the surface of what you are enjoined to not just avoid but even detest. <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/LEV+11.html\">It is fascinating reading</a>. If you&#39;re a biblical textualist, you have your work cut out for you.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/29/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["A","T","A","R","I",".","B","E","E",".",".","S","C","A","B","B","A","S","I","C","C","A","B","L","E",".","B","O","L","O","I","T","S","M","E","A","G","A","I","N",".","A","M","I","E","T","A","T","S",".","R","O","Y",".","C","A","R","E","E","R",".",".",".","H","A","L","F",".","T","A","M","R","O","N",".","I","S","P","O","K","E","T","O","O","S","O","O","N",".",".","D","E","L","T","A",".","R","A","G","E","S",".","D","D","S","E","R","O","S",".","P","I","T","A","S",".","P","O","R","K","A","F","T",".","B","I","C","E","P",".","N","O","W","A","Y",".",".","D","R","I","N","K","S","A","R","E","O","N","M","E",".","S","E","E","N","A","S",".","R","O","T","H",".",".",".","D","I","V","E","S","T",".","A","T","L",".","P","L","O","P","A","N","I","S",".","A","P","R","I","L","F","O","O","L","S","M","A","C","E",".","S","H","O","E","S","T","O","R","E","S","P","I","E","S",".",".","I","D","S",".","C","H","E","S","T"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,6,7,8,0,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,15,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,24,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,27,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,32,33,34,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,42,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,49,50,51,52,0,0,0,0,53,54,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
