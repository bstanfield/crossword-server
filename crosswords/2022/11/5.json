{"title":"New York Times, Saturday, November 5, 2022","author":"John Westwig","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"11/5/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who is making a game-saving CATCH in the World Series.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.byrdie.com/daith-piercing\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"flip right\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1907/3267/files/daithwm-andruvenus.jpg?12537882626222024937\" style=\"width:350px\" title=\"Daith piercing probably hurts\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There used to be only two questions about ear piercing: how much will it hurt, and should I ask mom for permission or forgiveness? Now, you need to decide between industrial, helix, forward helix, rook, DAITH, inner conch, outer conch, tragus, anti-tragus, upper lobe, and standard lobe. (<a href=\"https://www.byrdie.com/daith-piercing\">See chart here.</a>) Oh, go for all of the above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday clues can be amusing even when they&#39;re not hard. &quot;Phrase that&#39;s often contracted &hellip; or suffix for something contracted&quot; is clever and memorable. Sometimes they pull memories from deep in your past. At one time, you knew pocketful of POSY, but if you don&#39;t have kids, you haven&#39;t heard that in a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, your personal experience can help or hinder your solve. I live in Seattle, so I&#39;m unlikely to be fooled by &quot;Washington can only mean DC,&quot; and I have much familiarity with SEA-TAC. If you live on the east coast, that might be trickier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use METONYMs so often that it&#39;s easy to forget they&#39;re figures of speech. No, the White House didn&#39;t <em>literally</em> make a statement, but hearing that it did doesn&#39;t sound weird at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossword clues don&#39;t have to <em>always</em> be true. <em>Sometimes</em> true is close enough. Only a tiny wee itsy fraction of IOS APPs are products of Apple Inc, but a few are, and, especially on a Saturday, that&#39;s fair game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NENEH Cherry explained that Buffalo stance is &quot;an attitude you have to have in order to get by. It&#39;s not about fashion but about survival in inner cities and elsewhere.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JWsRz3TJDEY\"></iframe></div>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=11/5/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["S","C","R","I","B","E","S",".",".",".","J","A","M","U","P","T","H","E","C","A","T","C","H",".",".","I","R","A","N","I","E","A","S","Y","C","H","A","I","R",".","B","I","G","O","N","W","I","T",".","H","O","L","D","A","S","E","A","N","C","E","I","T","I","S",".","S","E","E","P","E","D",".","E","A","R","N","E","N","E","H",".","S","A","G","A",".","I","T","R","Y","G","A","G","L","A","W",".","N","O","T","G","O","O","D",".",".",".",".","F","I","E","L","D","D","A","Y","S",".",".",".",".","M","A","I","L","B","A","G",".","C","R","A","P","P","Y","R","O","D","E",".","A","D","O","S",".","O","P","E","R","A","I","B","M",".","C","R","I","S","P","S",".","P","O","S","Y","P","R","I","V","A","T","E","E","Y","E","S",".","R","A","T","O","U","T","E","R",".","S","E","C","R","E","T","I","V","E","F","L","I","R","T",".",".","K","A","V","A","K","A","V","A","F","E","T","A","S",".",".",".","M","E","T","O","N","Y","M"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,0,0,8,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,23,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,26,0,0,0,27,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,0,32,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,39,40,41,42,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,44,0,45,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,48,0,49,0,0,0,50,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,53,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
