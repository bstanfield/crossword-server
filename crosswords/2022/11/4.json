{"title":"New York Times, Friday, November 4, 2022","author":"Juliet Corless","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"11/4/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who chooses to go to the moon, not because it&#39;s easy, but because it&#39;s hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does today&#39;s grid look weird to you? Editors can and do, flip rows and columns on submitted crosswords. Which grid looks better?</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"/images/bonus/transpose.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"/images/bonus/transpose.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width:582px\" title=\"Flip flop\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The one on the right probably looks more <em>normal</em>. We&#39;re used to seeing long answers going Across. Sometimes they go Down for <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=4/29/2001&amp;g=10&amp;d=D\">thematic reasons</a>. Today&#39;s themeless seems to have long answers on the left and right edges purely for aesthetics. It looks a little like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/13/2002\">DNA strands</a>, right? (Both those previous links go to <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Elizabeth+C.+Gorski\">Elizabeth C. Gorski</a> puzzles.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the NYT debut for Juliet Corless, but you can tell this is not the work of a crossword novice. Several of her other puzzles are at <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/staff/juliet-corless\">The Daily Princetonian</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m always happy to see Phillipa SOO in a puzzle, although that will be tough if you&#39;re not a Hamilnerd. HOREB was the mountain where Moses got the tablets with the Ten Commandments written by the hand of God. Too bad he broke them. The tablets, I mean. Maybe the commandments, too, I&#39;m not sure. NCAA v Alston was a fight about the National Collegiate Athletic Association profiting from the namesakes and likenesses of college athletes. That&#39;s an antitrust violation, according to The Supremes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Auntie Em and Uncle Henry are bit roles from a 1939 MGM movie musical. I wonder what films made today will be seen as iconic 83 years from now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congratulations, Ms. Corless. It&#39;s an Amazeballs crossword.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=11/4/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["J","F","K",".","R","A","W","D","A","T","A",".","D","P","T","A","R","E",".","A","M","O","E","B","I","C",".","R","A","E","C","E","Y",".","F","E","R","R","I","T","E",".","A","R","M","K","A","N","S","A","N","S",".","D","U","S","T","M","O","P","O","K","O","K",".","S","E","X","E","S",".","H","A","L","O","F","I","T","I","N",".","N","E","D",".","H","A","T","E","R","A","N","E","M","O","N","E","S",".","G","O","D","I","V","A","L","G","S",".","T","A","D",".","B","A","R",".","C","I","R","L","A","P","D","O","G",".","R","E","D","E","P","L","O","Y","T","W","E","A","K",".","C","A","R",".","B","U","I","L","T","R","E","E","L",".","C","A","N","I","T",".","N","C","A","A","A","S","C","E","N","D","S",".","B","A","S","S","E","T","T","D","O","H",".","A","R","T","D","E","C","O",".","N","I","T","E","M","E",".","P","O","L","A","R","I","S",".","S","O","O","S","E","S",".","E","M","E","R","I","T","A",".","E","N","O"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,0,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,0,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,20,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,25,0,26,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,29,0,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,39,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,49,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,52,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,55,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1. &quot;We choose to go to the moon&quot; speaker, for short","4.
