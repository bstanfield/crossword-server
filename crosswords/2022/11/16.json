{"title":"New York Times, Wednesday, November 16, 2022","author":"John Hawksley","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"11/16/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who is dealing with a flurry of transcription errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg/250px-Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png\" style=\"border:none; width:250px\" title=\"sine and cosine\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We sometimes see complicated words in clues that we have to parse into likely component parts to divine their meanings. For example, &quot;Suffering from nyctophobia&quot; means <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=11/27/2011&amp;g=16&amp;d=D\">AFRAID OF THE DARK</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s puzzle flips that around &mdash; we get the complicated word in the answer &mdash; and then there&#39;s the new twist that your usual parsing strategy might lead you astray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARCTOPHILE is obviously a lover of ARCTO. Arcto means &quot;north&quot; or &quot;arctic&quot;, but arkt&oacute;s is also a Greek word for &quot;bear.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme answers might feel made up, but they&#39;re all in your dictionary. I know some <a href=\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/typomania\">TYPOMANIA</a>cs. The publishing business is tough to break into. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/pantophobia\">PANTOPHOBIA</a> is no longer in vogue. Medical professionals prefer <em>generalized anxiety disorder</em> or <em>panic disorder</em>. <a href=\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/manducate\">MANDUCATES</a> is perhaps more obvious, but the clue is funny. <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/search?q=define+metrology\">METROLOGY</a> isn&#39;t even a debut answer. You probably remember it from <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=4/25/1943&amp;g=34&amp;d=D\">that 1943 crossword</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The OK GO answer is more than reason enough to watch this amazing video.
