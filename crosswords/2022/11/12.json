{"title":"New York Times, Saturday, November 12, 2022","author":"Billy Bratton","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"11/12/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who is playing a small role in a superhero movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to make a Saturday crossword challenging is to include words you might not be familiar with. Recent Saturdays have asked us to know the technical term <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/15/2022&amp;g=32&amp;d=A\">PETABYTE</a>, the modern novelist/poet <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/1/2022&amp;g=27&amp;d=D\">OCEAN VUONG</a>, and the recent slang word <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/8/2022&amp;g=33&amp;d=A\">ZHUZH</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergirl\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/5ea82a8f4bff95d3f686cfc5c4bb96cd18ea1532/hub/2017/06/22/3c34448b-c996-4058-b3ec-00973ffa95af/supergirl-11.jpg?auto=webp&amp;fit=crop&amp;height=675&amp;width=1200\" style=\"width:623px\" title=\"Look, up in the sky. It's an ALIEN!\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s not the strategy today, where mostly common answer words could easily be clued at a Tuesday or Wednesday level. The difficulty is all in the clues, particularly those that play on initial assumptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&quot;Some budget graphics&quot; isn&#39;t about inexpensive line charts. They&#39;re graphics about budgets.</li>\r\n\t<li>&quot;Supergirl, eg.&quot; isn&#39;t looking for details about that specific superhero, only that she&#39;s an ALIEN.</li>\r\n\t<li>&quot;It resurfaces after 20 minutes&quot; doesn&#39;t refer to some denizen of the deep who emerges for oxygen after a long dive, it&#39;s about the machine that resurfaces the ice after a 20-minute period in hockey.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, what? ZAMBONI is a <em>common</em> answer word?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This explains why it&#39;s difficult to judge the difficulty of any crossword or write about it. It&#39;s natural to assume your common knowledge is, if not universal, at least common. If you grew up in Canada or if you love hockey, ZAMBONI is a delightfully clever answer to a misleading clue. Otherwise, it&#39;s just a string of letters in a disappointing puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zamboni or not, today&#39;s (mostly) common words means that your experience depends more on your ability to think creatively. If you like this sort of thing as much as I do, don&#39;t ignore the Puns and Anagrams and even the Cryptic crosswords that appear <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/SelectVariety\">every few weeks</a>.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=11/12/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["H","A","T",".",".","N","O","U","S","E",".","K","O","F","I","O","T","R","A",".","A","N","N","O","Y",".","I","R","A","N","T","H","A","T","S","M","Y","C","U","E",".","W","E","D","S","W","A","C","O","T","E","X","A","S",".","D","I","O","D","E","A","N","T","M","A","N",".","P","A","P","I",".","T","I","A","R","D","S",".","L","O","B",".",".","A","P","C","H","E","M",".",".",".","B","A","N","A","N","A","S","P","L","I","T",".",".",".","Y","O","G","A","S","E","S","S","I","O","N",".",".",".","Z","O","O","M","M","E","E","T","I","N","G",".",".",".","L","A","U","R","I","E",".",".","A","N","D",".","M","E","G","O","M","G",".","T","S","A","R",".","G","O","S","O","L","O","A","B","O","V","E",".","G","U","I","L","T","T","R","I","P","D","O","T","E",".","K","I","N","D","A","S","O","R","T","A","U","N","I","T",".","A","L","I","E","N",".","P","I","E","S","P","I","T","S",".","T","E","N","S","E",".",".","E","S","T"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,0,0,4,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,14,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,24,0,0,25,0,0,26,0,0,0,27,0,28,0,0,29,0,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,32,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,39,40,41,0,0,0,42,0,43,44,0,45,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,48,0,0,49,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,58,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
