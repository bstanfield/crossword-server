{"title":"New York Times, Wednesday, May 4, 2022","author":"Eric Bornstein","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"5/4/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>In his comments, Jeff links to a site called Rhyme Zone to find rhymes for attach&eacute;. XWord Info can also find rhymes. We use the same data source that Rhyme Zone does. <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?p=E4UwNg+sAWCeC8BDALsxBjaIg\">Here&#39;s our list of attach&eacute; rhymes</a>. Why duplicate their information? It&#39;s part of our ongoing drive to provide maximum value for constructors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rhyme Zone is part of the OneLook family. OneLook data knows a lot about words &mdash; what they mean, how they&#39;re used, how they&#39;re pronounced. <a href=\"https://xwordblog.com/2022/03/09/integrating-onelook/\">This blog post shows</a> how you can, for example, find words that match a pattern within a particular topic, or find phrases that include a specified word. XWord Info knows a lot about crosswords &mdash; which words are useful or dangerous, how words have been clued, etc. We aim to combine those two knowledge sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?p=E4UwNg+sAWCeC8BDALsxBjaIg\">our attach&eacute; rhymes</a> are color-coded (key below chart) so you can see which words have been used in modern NYT crosswords, which ones have only been used in pre-Shortz puzzles, which come from Jeff&#39;s database but have never been used in a NYT puzzle, and which come only from a dictionary. Clicking words that have NYT history shows all the clues for that word. Other words link to definitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A quick primer on Search vs OneLook Search</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our two main search buttons labeled <strong>Search</strong> and <strong>OneLook search</strong> are useful for different reasons. <em>For pattern matches, it&#39;s often a good idea to click both.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Search</strong> gets results from our internal database, which includes every NYT crossword, Jeff&#39;s list, and several dictionaries.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>OneLook search</strong> gets results from their external source.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples (click links to see results)</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If you enter a single word, say <strong>PLANET</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=PLANET\">Search</a> button shows every NYT clue. <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?dm=AoGQggcgogKkA\" rel=\"nofollow\">OneLook search</a> shows definitions.</li>\r\n\t<li>If you enter a pattern like <strong>PL*T</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=PL*T\">Search</a> button and the <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?dm=AoGQVAKkA\" rel=\"nofollow\">OneLook search</a> button show different results.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Importantly for constructors, both result sets can be sorted by NYT usage frequency, word length, or by Jeff&#39;s word score.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that you may have to click <strong>More OneLook..</strong>. to see advanced features like synonyms, antonyms, rhymes, triggers (other words that tend to occur with your word), and words that precede or follow yours.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=5/4/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["Z","A","P",".",".","T","H","E","D","O","W",".","I","C","E","I","L","L","S",".","E","U","G","E","N","E",".","N","H","L","T","O","U","C","H","E","T","Y","P","E","S",".","C","A","L","I","N","T","R","O",".",".","P","T","S",".","D","O","P","E",".","G","O","E","S","O","N","T","H","E","L","A","M","E",".",".",".",".","E","T","N","A",".",".","C","A","M","E","R","A","A","L","A","N",".","I","F","S","O",".","S","E","T","O","N","R","E","V",".","A","T","T","A","C","H","E",".","A","N","A","I","T","A","L","Y",".","A","T","T","A",".","A","X","E","L","A","S","L","E","E","P",".",".","A","N","A","T",".",".",".",".","P","A","S","S","E","J","U","D","G","M","E","N","T",".","S","A","N","S",".","Y","E","N",".",".","E","M","A","I","L","A","R","C",".","G","O","T","D","O","W","N","P","A","T","E","N","T","H",".","A","T","T","I","L","A",".","O","C","H","O","D","Y","E",".","L","E","A","D","E","R",".",".","P","E","N"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,0,0,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,0,0,14,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,25,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,30,31,32,0,0,33,0,34,35,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,40,0,0,41,0,0,42,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,47,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,50,51,0,0,0,0,52,53,0,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,57,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,60,61,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
