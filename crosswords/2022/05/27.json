{"title":"New York Times, Friday, May 27, 2022","author":"David Distenfeld","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"5/27/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here. sitting in for Jeff who&#39;s getting his mustache waxed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CATFISHES is already a decent answer, but it&#39;s an interesting editorial choice to clue it as a verb since the slang sense it points to is creepy. It doesn&#39;t mean pretending to be a Nigerian prince to get your SSN, it means preying on the vulnerable lovelorn by faking romance, with the ultimate goal of, well, let&#39;s leave it at just financial gain. It&#39;s an evocative term. It&#39;s new. It&#39;s an important concept in modern digital life. It&#39;s today&#39;s 1-Across.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots to love today. My themeless endorphin levels vary with the clue cleverness, and there are some good ones here: &quot;Follower of many state names&quot; for EDU, and &quot;Modern-day scroll&quot; for TWITTER FEED stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEN MATTE is obscure enough that it gets a dictionary clue, but it&#39;s sandwiched between two good answers with outstanding clues: &quot;Where to find 55 and over&quot; for RADIO DIAL, and &quot;Parents obsessed with play dates&quot; for STAGE MOMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_(play)\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://daytonperformingarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-0054_SalomeA-e1552742799172.jpg\" style=\"width:700px\" title=\"Don't lose your head\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>SALOME would have to be considered a tragedy, at least for John the Baptist whose head gets served on a platter to the spoiled title character after she strips to the famous Dance of the Seven Veils. That&#39;s how it goes in Strauss&#39;s opera version anyway, and also in the play, and I&#39;m guessing also in that old book from which the Herod v John story derives. Sex and violence. Two staples of both opera and the Bible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crosswords are full of conventions you just have to learn. One is that clues like &quot;They&#39;re used during film production and promotion&quot; can be puns. Those are different kinds of TRAILERS but having the same name is good enough for crosswords. Too much logic will spoil your fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another convention you need to internalize is the occasional focus on spelling rather than meaning, like &quot;What makes Dr. Dre?&quot; for ANE, or &quot;Aisle&#39;s head&quot; for SILENT A. Today we have &quot;Myanmar has two&quot; for EMS. As you solve more crosswords, your reaction to these will go from &quot;So unfair!&quot; to &quot;Damn, I got fooled again!&quot; to &quot;Yeah, totally saw that coming. Next.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and Mr. Distenfeld, your resplendent constructor notes are amazeballs.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=5/27/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["C","A","T","F","I","S","H","E","S",".","T","O","A","S","T","O","N","E","I","N","C","O","M","E",".","R","U","L","E","D","L","O","N","G","P","A","U","S","E",".","A","T","L","A","S",".",".",".","S","A","L","S",".","S","K","I","R","T",".",".","I","T","T",".","I","D","E","S",".","A","L","O","H","A","S","T","O","W",".","N","E","W","H","I","R","E",".","E","D","U","A","R","I","D",".","D","I","E","H","A","R","D","F","A","N","L","O","T","U","S",".","N","B","A",".","S","E","E","P","S","I","N","T","H","E","W","E","E","D","S",".","F","E","T","E","A","T","E",".","T","I","S","A","N","E","S",".","L","E","T","N","O","R","M","A","N",".","R","O","N","A",".","S","R","S",".",".","F","U","D","G","E",".","I","S","L","A",".",".",".","O","P","E","R","A",".","R","A","D","I","O","D","I","A","L","W","H","E","A","T",".","O","P","E","N","M","A","T","T","E","S","I","D","L","E",".","S","T","A","G","E","M","O","M","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,21,0,0,0,0,0,22,23,24,0,25,0,0,26,0,27,0,0,0,28,29,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,33,0,0,34,0,0,35,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,44,0,45,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,49,0,0,50,0,0,51,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,55,0,56,0,0,57,0,0,0,58,59,0,0,0,0,60,61,0,0,0,0,62,63,64,65,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
