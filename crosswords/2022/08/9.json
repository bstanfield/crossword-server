Prepare for outrage in the blogosphere anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossword puzzles have their own rules. Or rather, they have no rules, only conventions, which they happily break whenever they want, all for your amusement. The grid art today looks vaguely like a slingshot. That&#39;s good enough. It doesn&#39;t matter that the slingshot David (if he existed) used against Goliath (if that event occurred) would look nothing like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In pre-modern times, the slingshot was a destructive and deadly weapon, similar in impact to a rifle today. A soft pouch held a rock or pebble. It was attached to a couple of long strands of leather. You&#39;d swing it around your head a few times to build momentum and then precisely aim at your target. Unlike other weapons of the time, it was effective against armor or shields. See the photo in Jeff&#39;s note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The David v. Goliath story is an odd one anyway. All poor Goliath had was a spear. You or I could have conquered the big guy as easily as David did with a bit of practice and the world&#39;s most deadly weapon. Hardly the &quot;underdog prevailing&quot; story we&#39;re used to.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Tuesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=8/9/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["S","E","W",".",".","T","I","N","C","T",".",".","A","D","S","U","S","A",".","E","N","D","U","R","E","S",".","D","I","P","M","A","R",".","G","O","L","I","A","T","H",".","Z","O","O","O","U","T","V","O","T","E",".","T","R","A","B","E","R","T",".",".",".","A","M","E","R","I","C","A","N","O",".",".",".","J","O","L","L","A",".","I","S","H",".","T","O","I","L","S","O","N","E","L","S",".","C","S","I",".","Y","K","N","O","W","R","I","D","E","S",".","H","O","T",".","T","O","R","T","E","G","O","T","Y","A",".",".",".",".",".","O","F","U","S","E","E","N","V","O","G","U","E",".","L","O","W","S","N","A","P",".",".",".","F","E","S","S",".","A","N","N","A",".",".",".","J","O","N","E","S","E","S",".","Y","E","S","M","A","A","M","U","R","A","L",".","D","A","V","I","D",".","U","C","L","A","M","E","T","A",".","T","Y","I","N","G",".","E","M","I","T","P","O","S","H",".","O","S","A","G","E",".","L","E","T","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,0,0,4,5,6,7,8,0,0,9,10,11,12,0,0,0,13,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,15,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,19,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,26,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,29,0,30,31,32,33,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,42,43,0,44,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,49,50,0,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,52,53,54,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,57,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
