{"title":"New York Times, Friday, August 26, 2022","author":"Robert Logan","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"8/26/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who is herding his pet nanobots.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_television\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://samoaglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_20210627-191746_Chrome-1.jpg\" style=\"width:623px\" title=\"The wonderful world of color\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s a weird-looking grid layout. It reminds me of diagramless puzzles like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Variety?date=5/30/1999\">this one</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Variety?date=2/7/2010\">this one</a>. There&#39;s a specific reason diagramless grids look odd &mdash; they try to disguise how the answers interlock as long as possible. But what basis might a standard Friday themeless offering have for looking like this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s unclear until you get to the revealer (a revealer on a Friday?) at the bottom right. Until then, you can enjoy it like a standard themeless, and it has plenty to enjoy. Then the EVEN ODDS answer explains the constraint that forces the grid shape into contortions. It&#39;s more a curiosity than a theme. It certainly doesn&#39;t help you solve, but it&#39;s a satisfying way to uncover the layout mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davy Jones (not the one of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Jones's_locker\">locker</a> fame) was indeed, along with Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz, and Michael Nesmith, a MONKEE. This constructed-for-TV group was one of the best-selling bands of the 1960s, even though everyone knew the actors didn&#39;t actually play on the recordings. Here&#39;s the great Cassandra Wilson showing how <em>The Last Train to Clarksville</em> can sound in the hands of master jazz musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:75.00%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OPmU5HxazM\"></iframe></div>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=8/26/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["A","L","P","H","A","D","O","G",".","B","R","Y","A","N","T","W","E","R","E","D","O","N","E",".","B","O","O","G","I","E","O","V","E","R","P","L","A","N",".","S","O","U","R","C","E","R","E","E","D",".","B","L","U","R",".",".","B","E","A","N","D","E","N","S",".","Y","E","S","I","N","D","E","E","D","Y",".",".",".",".",".",".","R","E","P","O","R","T",".",".",".","N","A","N","O","B","O","T","S",".","R","E","C","O","I","L","S","M","O","K","E","R",".",".",".","T","A","H","I","T","I","A","P","T","E","S","T",".","S","C","H","M","A","L","T","Z",".",".",".","Y","O","H","O","H","O",".",".",".",".",".",".","H","A","R","D","T","O","T","E","L","L",".","F","R","O","M","O","R","E","O",".",".","S","L","O","E",".","R","I","C","E","M","O","N","K","E","E",".","T","R","A","V","O","L","T","A","E","S","T","E","E","M",".","I","T","S","A","D","E","A","L","Y","E","S","Y","O","U",".","E","V","E","N","O","D","D","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,21,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,25,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,29,30,31,32,33,0,0,0,34,0,0,35,36,37,38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,46,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,49,50,51,52,53,0,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,57,58,0,59,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
