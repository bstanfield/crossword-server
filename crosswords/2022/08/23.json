No masks required, but everyone is cranky, and your luggage will end up in Barcelona, so there are pros and cons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smooth sailing today, though, as airplane-related answers complete the flight plan from abbreviated state to state. I&#39;m a sucker for novelty, and I&#39;ve never seen a theme like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original theme, and a new constructor. That&#39;s not a coincidence. Fresh blood bringing in new ideas is part of the plan. The Times made an interesting decision to open-source crossword creation. Every Wordplay post includes tips on &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/crosswords/how-to-make-a-crossword-puzzle-the-series.html\" title=\"\">How to Make a Crossword Puzzle</a>&quot; and this encouraging note for the construction-curious: &quot;The New York Times Crossword has an open submission system, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/submissions/crossword\" title=\"\">you can submit your puzzles online</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NYT is literally diversifying its crosswords by bringing in new DNA. I have no special insight, but that has to make the editorial team&#39;s job harder. Not only will they be sifting through many more submissions, but crosswords from neophytes will likely need more polish to get up to NYT standards. They&#39;re betting they&#39;ll find puzzle gems and promising new voices somewhere in that haystack. It&#39;s a good bet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That work is not just important, it&#39;s necessary to keep crosswords evolving in a changing world.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Tuesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=8/23/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["S","L","A","T",".","G","O","T","U","P",".","E","D","N","A","T","E","C","H",".","I","N","A","N","E",".","A","R","A","B","A","I","D","E",".","V","A","P","O","R","T","R","A","I","L","R","A","C","H","A","E","L",".",".","S","I","N","G","L","E",".",".",".","U","N","I","O","N","D","U","E","S",".",".",".","L","A","N","D","I","N","G","G","E","A","R",".","D","A","B","E","X","I","S","T",".",".","O","L","D",".","L","O","L","A","M","I","N","O","A","N","S",".","L","E","T","I","N","O","N","M","O","O","N",".","E","Y","E",".",".","H","O","O","H","A","E","M","S",".","C","O","N","T","I","N","E","N","T","A","L",".",".",".","V","O","L","C","A","N","O","E","S",".",".",".","B","O","L","E","R","O",".",".","G","L","U","G","G","E","D","F","L","Y","I","N","G","T","I","M","E",".","A","L","S","O","F","I","N","N",".","I","O","T","A","S",".","T","E","S","T","S","O","N","S",".","C","O","O","R","S",".","E","N","O","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,27,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,30,31,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,37,0,38,0,39,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,41,0,42,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49,50,51,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,53,54,55,56,0,0,0,0,0,57,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0],"circles":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
