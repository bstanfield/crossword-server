Several people reached out to ask if they could take it over. I sent them the lengthy list of technologies involved in XWord Info. That was enough to scare them off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, this Jeff Chen guy sent me mail with the same offer. When I asked him if he was familiar with the listed tech, he replied, &quot;No, but it&#39;s just another puzzle, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perfect answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;d never met Jeff before. I didn&#39;t learn until later that he lived just across Seattle&#39;s I-90 bridge from me.
