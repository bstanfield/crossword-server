{"title":"New York Times, Saturday, June 18, 2022","author":"Brooke Husic","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"6/18/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who&#39;s working on his skincare routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you want to get from solving crosswords? What do you want to accomplish by constructing one?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answers feel like they should be obvious. Constructors like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Lynn+Lempel\">Lynn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Robyn+Weintraub\">Robyn</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Patrick+Berry\">Patrick</a> get praised, here and elsewhere, for their skill in building smooth puzzles within a crossword&#39;s crazy constraints. And no question, they&#39;re brilliant, and their puzzles are fun. You usually learn a few facts from them, but the learning never feels forced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crosswords are changing, though, and more constructors with a point of view realize they have a platform and an opportunity to express an opinion. To push people out of their comfort zone. To point out what the quiet, comfortable puzzles are leaving out, and open a window to worlds and people and cultures that NYT crosswords have neglected. I&#39;ve come to appreciate that, and I have constructors like Brooke Husic to thank.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Chiwetel_Ejiofor_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/220px-Chiwetel_Ejiofor_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\" style=\"width:220px\" title=\"Chiwetel Ejiofor\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the top-left corner. I haven&#39;t read comics since childhood, but I had no idea there were queer DC characters. SUPERMAN wore his underwear over his blue tights, so maybe &quot;heroine&quot; is his preferred identifier? No, it&#39;s BATWOMAN. Fascinating! (Are gay references in NYT crosswords becoming more common? Yes!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Literally, &quot;high city&quot;] is another great clue. Acrophobia is a fear of heights, and OPLIS seems like a city, so it&#39;s an answer you can get by thinking about it. It&#39;s Saturday-tricky because you think about the Acropolis of Athens which itself isn&#39;t a city, per se.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we get to CHIWETEL EJIOFOR at 16-Across. Even if you saw the film and even if you remember his name, you might have no idea how to spell it. Unfair! It&#39;s a weird name, so it&#39;s not remotely inferable!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is, it&#39;s weird to <em>you</em>. Others will celebrate his inclusion and feel that the NYT crossword welcomes them in too. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor\">Mr. Ejiofor&#39;s successes and awards</a> make him worthy of inclusion in a crossword.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you feel like you&#39;re being preached to? Get used to it. There will always be gentler puzzles but expect Saturday puzzles, in particular, to keep expanding the traditional ambit of knowledge.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=6/18/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["B","A","T","W","O","M","A","N",".",".",".","B","L","I","P","A","C","R","O","P","O","L","I","S",".","F","R","I","D","A","C","H","I","W","E","T","E","L","E","J","I","O","F","O","R","K","I","T",".","D","I","X",".","C","U","R","I","E",".",".","S","N","O","G",".","F","A","D",".","M","E","L","O","N","S",".","G","N","U","S",".","N","E","A","P",".",".","F","A","T",".",".",".","N","E","R","D","F","E","S","T",".","P","A","Y","S","K","I","N","C","A","R","E","R","O","U","T","I","N","E","P","A","N",".","T","W","I","N","I","N","G","S",".",".",".","E","L","F",".",".","N","A","D","A",".","S","K","I","T",".","D","I","O","N","N","E",".","S","L","Y",".","S","N","I","P",".",".","R","O","A","S","T",".","Y","O","O",".","S","N","L","T","I","M","E","I","S","O","N","O","U","R","S","I","D","E","S","M","E","L","L",".","V","A","G","U","E","I","D","E","A","P","O","D","S",".",".",".","T","A","P","S","T","E","R","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,0,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,22,0,23,0,24,0,25,0,0,0,26,27,0,28,0,0,29,0,30,0,31,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,33,0,34,0,0,0,0,35,0,36,0,0,37,38,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,45,0,46,47,0,48,0,0,49,50,0,0,51,0,52,0,53,0,0,54,0,0,55,0,0,0,56,0,57,0,58,0,59,0,0,60,61,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
