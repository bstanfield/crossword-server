Note the quotes. &quot;Hamlet&quot; stresses the first syllable, so it&#39;s a trochee. &quot;Macbeth&quot; stresses the second, so it&#39;s an IAMB &mdash; that thing where, when you string five of them together, you get iambic pentameter. At that point, you&#39;re basically Shakespeare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For this fine crossword, I will now explain<br />\r\nThe bonus theme and all that it entails.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, we take well-known movie titles and add an extra letter (a &quot;bonus&quot;, I suppose) to fit the goofy clue. <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em> becomes a &quot;Rodeo Drive uprising&quot; when we add a U to turn COP into COUP. By now, we&#39;re conditioned to expect a <em>bonus layer </em>in add-a-letter puzzles. We highlighted the bonus letters and, reading top to bottom, they spell OUTTAKES which are often included in movie bonus features.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.49a2ed28f8a02996b270fc257764545c?rik=9OzHAW4I%2bQIeiw&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fscreenrant.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f02%2fpans-labyrinth-title.jpg&amp;ehk=h7PNJ%2b1yqJkrXy16vCR2%2b1DquBWEZrwTBJW6RyqJypU%3d&amp;risl=&amp;pid=ImgRaw&amp;r=0\" style=\"width:700px\" title=\"Pan without the tangle\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&quot;Cry from a boxing coach&quot; is HIT &#39;EM?
