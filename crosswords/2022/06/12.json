Will Nediger. That name sounds familiar...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mission statement for XWord Info &mdash; to celebrate NYT crosswords and the people who make them &mdash; came from an early observation I made in 2007 when I was first experimenting with what I could learn from NYT puzzle data. At the time, The Times made their crossword archive back to 1996 available in digital format, so it was easy to extract clues and answers, and analyze them. As I worked through past puzzles, I discovered that many of the ones I most enjoyed were by the same constructor, a medical doctor in San Francisco named <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Manny+Nosowsky\">Manny Nosowsky</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you read novels, you&#39;re aware of the authors and you seek them out. Sophisticated filmgoers follow their favorite directors. (Why not screenwriters? Long story.) I wanted to help crossword solvers have that same connection with the geniuses behind the grids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Will+Nediger\">Will Nediger has a particular style</a>, and it&#39;s independent of venue. His New Yorker crosswords bear his personal mark too. Every constructor has a personal style. They can&#39;t help it. Some styles and some constructors will resonate more with you. I happen to love Mr. Nediger&#39;s. Knowing who wrote the puzzle helps me enjoy it more, and knowing their proclivities can make me a better solver. You can get a sense for a constructor&#39;s individualism by looking at the <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/WordsByCon?author=Will+Nediger\">words they debuted</a> and their <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/WordCloud?author=Will+Nediger\">word cloud</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s theme is phrases about repeating things that repeat a key word from earlier in the grid. Excellent Sunday theme. A few notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The L-BOMB at 26-Across refers to saying, &quot;I love you.&quot; Go for it!</li>\r\n\t<li>___ particle at 104-Across is just a way to clue a random Greek letter.</li>\r\n\t<li>Is REBLOG at 96-Down a word? Apparently so.</li>\r\n\t<li>Activist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ay%E1%BB%8D_Tometi\">Ayọ Tometi</a> has a dot under the ọ in her first name. (Her parents are Nigerian.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Will Nediger doesn&#39;t like AN I as an answer, but for me, the cute clue at 78-Across saves it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>One more observation. Crosswords, for better or worse, shy away from words that might offend, but they revel in clues that seem titillating, Did &quot;Be on the bottom&quot; at 42-Down make you think of sex? You pervert!</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Sunday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=6/12/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":true,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":21,"cols":21},"grid":["A","S","K","S",".",".","C","O","C","O",".","T","O","O","L",".","E","L","M","E","R","T","H","I","N","G",".","O","A","H","U",".","E","X","P","O",".","N","A","O","M","I","R","O","D","E","O",".","A","T","I","T",".","C","H","I","N",".","L","B","O","M","B","A","N","D","A","N","O","T","H","E","R","T","H","I","N","G",".","I","O","T","A","S","I","D","I","D","N","T",".",".","F","E","E",".","D","E","J","A","V","U",".",".",".","N","A","E",".","A","I","M","E","D",".","L","I","E",".","O","V","E","R","S","E","E",".",".",".",".",".","O","S","M","O","S","E","S",".","S","H","I","N","D","I","G","S","T","H","I","S","I","S","N","T","M","Y",".","A","S","A","N","A",".","A","T","O","P","R","A","M","O","N","E",".",".",".","R","I","Y","A","L",".","T","O","Y",".",".",".","A","D","U","L","T",".","P","E","R","I","L",".","V","I","S","O","R",".","R","N","A","I","T","S","D","E","J","A","V","U","A","L","L","O","V","E","R","A","G","A","I","N","L","O","T",".","R","A","Y","O","N",".","B","O","R","A","X",".","T","Y","P","E","D",".",".",".","A","N","I",".","K","O","R","E","A",".",".",".","S","O","N","I","C","S","B","A","B","Y",".","A","R","E","N","A",".","F","I","R","S","T","R","O","D","E","O","U","N","R","O","L","L","E","D",".","R","U","S","S","O","L","O",".",".",".",".",".","M","A","R","T","I","A","L",".","R","E","P",".","S","T","Y","N","E",".","G","M","O",".",".",".","O","P","I","A","T","E",".","T","A","U",".",".","E","N","S","U","E","D","M","I","A","M","I",".","B","A","B","Y","O","N","E","M","O","R","E","T","I","M","E","O","N","S","E","T",".","E","L","L","E",".","I","D","E","A",".","M","E","L","O","N","D","I","T","T","O",".","L","I","O","N",".","S","T","A","R",".","Y","E","T","I","S","S","T","A","I","R",".","S","A","G","S",".","E","O","N","S",".",".","L","Y","R","E"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,0,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,0,13,14,15,16,17,18,0,0,0,19,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,33,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,37,38,0,0,39,40,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,43,44,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,49,50,51,52,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,58,0,0,0,0,59,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,62,63,64,0,0,0,65,0,66,0,0,0,67,68,69,70,0,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,0,72,0,0,0,0,0,73,0,0,0,74,0,0,0,75,0,0,0,0,0,76,0,0,0,0,0,77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,78,0,0,0,79,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,81,0,0,0,0,0,82,83,84,0,0,85,86,0,0,0,0,87,88,89,90,0,0,0,0,0,0,91,0,0,0,92,0,0,0,0,93,94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,96,0,0,0,97,0,0,0,98,0,99,100,101,0,0,0,102,0,0,0,103,0,0,104,105,0,0,0,106,0,107,0,0,0,108,109,110,0,0,0,111,0,0,112,0,0,0,113,114,0,0,0,0,0,0,115,0,0,0,0,0,116,0,0,0,0,117,0,0,0,0,118,0,0,0,0,119,0,0,0,0,0,120,0,0,0,0,121,0,0,0,0,122,0,0,0,0,123,0,0,0,0,0,124,0,0,0,0,125,0,0,0,0,0,126,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
