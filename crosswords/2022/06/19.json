{"title":"Some Light Reading","author":"Jeremy Newton","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"6/19/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who&#39;s stuck at a red light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first national color television broadcast in the United States was the 1954 Rose Parade, but crosswords are mostly still monochrome. For 25 years, NYT relied on Across Lite&#39;s .puz format to distribute puzzles to their most enthusiastic solvers, a format that didn&#39;t support color, most foreign characters, or other modern gimmicks. That format is now history, but color is still rare. Even at the Times, some of their distribution channels are black and white only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s gimmick couldn&#39;t work without color. Blocks of three black squares have colored circles representing traffic lights. What&#39;s more, they&#39;re rebus elements. And, the rebus has to be interpreted differently Across and Down. That&#39;s a wild combination we&#39;ve never encountered before.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastigirl\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/092418elast.jpg\" style=\"width:623px\" title=\"Helen PARR, aka Elastigirl\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be confusing for newer solvers, so I&#39;ll spell it out:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ignore the gray circles. Only the color ones matter.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Across answers use the color names. So, 103-Across is CATCH [RED] HANDED and 109-Across is THE JOLLY [GREEN] GIANT.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Down answers use the color meanings. So, 35-Down is HEART [STOP] PING, and 37-Down is DON&#39;T [GO] THERE.</li>\r\n\t<li>The yellow light at 43-Down is ambiguous. The answer is either I&#39;LL GO NOW or I&#39;LL STOP NOW depending on how aggressively you drive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the orientation of the lights is correct &mdash; red on top and green on the bottom. Why is this important? So RED/GREEN color-blind drivers know which pedal to press as they tootle around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electric cars don&#39;t have MPG (39-Across), but they do have MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), so you can compare efficiencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in 1999 when USENET (18-Down) was still a thing, the Times invited Usenet users from around the world to contribute to <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Variety?date=6/13/1999\">this Cryptic Crossword</a>.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Sunday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=6/19/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":true,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":21,"cols":21},"grid":["I","T","S","B","A","D",".","I","N","F","R","A",".","S","P","E","C","T","R","U","M","O","R","E","I","D","A",".","B","A","A","E","D",".","L","I","K","E","W","I","S","E","W","I","N","T","E","R",".","M","I","N","T","S",".","U","N","G","L","O","V","E","D","A","P","T","E","S","T","S",".","L","G","A",".","G","I","T","S",".","P","A","N","S","N","O","R","M",".",".","T","H","E","S","P","I","A","N","S",".","H","A","L","E",".",".","D","Y","E","D","H","A","I","R",".",".","M","P","G",".","D","E","I","S","T",".",".",".",".",".","O","I","L","S",".","T","I","P","S",".","D","E","A","R",".",".",".",".","S","I","G","N","E","E",".","E","E","L","S",".","B","O","A","R",".","P","S","I",".","A","L","O","T",".",".","B","I","E","L",".","S","A","N","D","T","R","A","P","S",".","T","O","V",".","D","O","U","G","H",".","V","O","D","K","A",".","B","U","L","L","D","I","V","E",".","I","N","T","H","E",".","P","A","G","E","S",".","I","L","I","E","E","V","E","R",".","S","T","A","T","E",".","P","R","E","Y","S",".","M","I","C",".","P","A","I","N","T","C","A","N","S",".","N","I","T","S",".",".","P","A","N","E",".","P","S","T",".","H","O","P","E",".","C","O","C","O",".","M","A","I","N","E","R",".",".",".",".","H","E","R","E",".","H","A","W","K",".","Y","A","W","N",".",".",".",".",".","T","B","I","R","D",".","N","A","P",".",".","F","A","K","E","G","O","L","D",".",".","H","A","R","E",".","L","O","S","E","A","G","A","M","E",".",".","P","E","E","L","P","A","R","E",".","R","E","B","A",".","S","O","L",".","A","T","P","E","A","C","E","S","T","R","A","T","E","G","O",".","C","A","T","C","H",".","H","A","N","D","E","D","A","C","I","D","H","E","A","D",".","O","H","Y","O","U",".","A","R","M","I","N","G","T","H","E","J","O","L","L","Y",".","G","I","A","N","T",".","T","R","E","N","T","E"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,0,7,8,9,10,11,0,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,28,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,32,33,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,37,38,0,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,42,43,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,46,47,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,50,51,52,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,58,59,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,70,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,0,72,0,0,0,0,0,73,0,0,0,0,74,0,0,0,75,0,0,0,0,76,0,0,0,0,77,78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,79,0,0,0,0,80,0,0,0,0,81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,83,0,0,0,0,84,0,0,0,0,85,0,0,0,0,86,87,88,0,0,89,0,0,0,0,90,0,0,0,91,92,0,0,0,0,0,93,0,0,94,95,0,0,0,0,96,0,0,0,0,97,0,0,0,98,99,100,0,0,0,0,101,0,0,0,102,0,0,0,0,103,0,0,0,104,0,105,0,0,0,0,0,106,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,107,0,0,0,0,0,108,0,0,0,0,0,109,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,110,0,0,0,0,0,111,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1. &quot;In a word ... awful!&quot;","7.
