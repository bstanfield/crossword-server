{"title":"New York Times, Saturday, June 25, 2022","author":"Adam Aaronson","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"6/25/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen who is performing in both the Winter and Summer Olympics, in different sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This one is easy, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoa, Jim, you know better than that! Your life experiences, including the percentage of your life you devote to crosswords, are uniquely your own. You know things that I don&#39;t, and vice versa. But still. 1-Across has to be IMHO, and 5-Across is clearly SPACE FORCE, so before we&#39;ve completely settled into our Eames puzzle chair, we&#39;ve got two Across answers and the first letter of fourteen Downs. Fortunately, my ego boost was temporary, as the rest of the puzzle provided more resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3566726/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jane-the-virgin-recap.jpg?w=620&amp;h=420&amp;crop=1\" style=\"width:516px\" title=\"Is Jane the Virgin a telenovela parody, or a telenovela?\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>TELENOVELA (&quot;soap in Mexico&quot;) ought to be a constructor&#39;s dream word, with its alternating vowels and useful consonants, Jeff tells me it&#39;s more common in other venues, but this is only <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=12/25/2015&amp;g=54&amp;d=A\">its second appearance</a> in the NYT. Juliet CAPULET is a prototypical &quot;star-crossed lover.&quot; (I hope I didn&#39;t spoil the ending.) REAL MATURE is an evocative phrase. &quot;Chains of churches&quot; describes literal ROSARIES.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pro tip: &quot;Home&quot; as in &quot;Standing at home&quot; often refers to baseball. &quot;Course&quot; as in &quot;Course pro&quot; often refers to either golf or meals. Other seemingly odd words like &quot;shell&quot; often refer to food, although not pasta this time. You &quot;put away shells&quot; at a TAQUERIA. Poke is often food too but, PSST, it&#39;s a literal finger poke today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you Team Stridex or Team OXY?
