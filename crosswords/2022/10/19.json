{"title":"New York Times, Wednesday, October 19, 2022","author":"Ryan Patrick Smith","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/19/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who is trying to figure out whether NENE and ISIS are <em>reduplicative </em>or just <em>duplicative</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jokes in this puzzle, in case you&#39;ve led a sheltered life, are called Tom Swifties. You don&#39;t need to know that, but if you find them amusing, you can now search for lots more. &quot;I can&#39;t remember what I was supposed to buy here at the store,&quot; said Tom listlessly. And so on. A Tom Swifty crossword relies on the cleverness of the answers, and these are all good. I appreciate that two of the four end, not with simple adverbs, but with phrases. IN VERY POOR TASTE is tasty. FRANKLY INCENSED is hilarious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LMFAO is clued delicately as &quot;Electronic dance music duo,&quot; but we all know it stands for Laughing My Ass Off. Or something similar. Crosswords, at least at the NYT, has always danced close to the edge between titillation and offense, and that edge changes over time as culture changes. Innovative words creep in, sex references are more common, but it&#39;s not just an expansion of acceptability. As sensibilities adapt, we become squeamish about certain words that used to feel fine. (Anyone who watches the news knows that describing this as &quot;woke&quot; can praise or insult.) Why is it ok to see <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=IDI\">IDI</a> <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=AMIN\">AMIN</a> in a crossword but not <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=HITLER\">HITLER</a>? It&#39;s complicated. Words like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=CANCER\">CANCER</a> are avoided even though there&#39;s an anodyne astronomy meaning. Let&#39;s not talk about the baseball term <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=BEANER\">BEANER</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who gets to decide if an answer word is amusing or offensive? That would be the editor, and this is a game no editor can win. Will Shortz knows he can&#39;t please everyone, so he and his team try to thread the needle as best they can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indie puzzles can be instructive counterexamples, often finding humor by pushing traditional taste boundaries while striving to be more culturally expansive. From the perspective of mainstream publications, they provide a helpful laboratory for how their own puzzles might evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQ6zr6kCPj8\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There sure have been a lot of <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=IAMB\">IAMB</a>-related clues recently, I think.
