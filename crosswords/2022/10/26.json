{"title":"New York Times, Wednesday, October 26, 2022","author":"Simeon Seigel","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/26/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who is still telling his often-repeated golf story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know, I know, you&#39;re disappointed Jeff&#39;s not available, and you&#39;re afraid I might bring up the dreaded RegEx. Fear not! Today, we talk Python. If you know a little bit about programming, I have a recipe for how you can find words that fit today&#39;s theme yourself at the end of this post. If not, we can still discuss technology in crosswords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone suspects that computers are somehow involved in construction. That might feel like cheating. There were undoubtedly some master craftsmen and women who created impressive grids before personal computers were available, but trust me, the overall quality of fill now is way better than it was 20 years ago. Still, we don&#39;t want our puzzles to <em>feel</em> computer-generated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They don&#39;t because computers, at least today, can only take construction so far. Machines can quickly find many alternatives for your fill or, just as important, quickly determine if a corner is likely unfillable, but many iterations informed by a human&#39;s artistic sense are needed to create a puzzle worthy of publication. It&#39;s common for constructors to spend months working on an idea that might never work out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Computers help in other ways too. If you&#39;re the thousandth person to include EMU or OREO in a grid, you can search the web for an interesting tidbit to include in a clue. If your theme is words that include some peculiar property, maybe all the letters are in reverse alphabetical order, you can find lists of such words. And if you want to find words with no vowels other than E or E is the only vowel, you can have your neighbor&#39;s kid write a Python script or a RegEx query after he mows your lawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/eniac-woman-programmers\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-image-of-three-women-each-in-front-of-a-large-wheeled-cabinet-faced-with-countless-rotary-switches.jpg?id=29705856&amp;width=1200&amp;height=796\" style=\"width:528px\" title=\"Programming the ENIAC\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Someday there will be a successful Crossword Turing Test where it will be impossible to tell if a new puzzle had any human intervention. Computers can already solve puzzles as quickly as all but the fastest humans. I hope they feel the same joy I do when I complete a grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Here are the promised programming steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Crank up your Python environment. (<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\">Here&#39;s a good free one</a>.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Copy and paste script #3 from our <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Python\">Python Samples</a> page.</li>\r\n\t<li>Download the <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/WordList\">latest XWord Info word list</a> (requires an <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Levels\">Angel account</a>) and copy it into the same folder as your Python program.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Running that program returns many results, including all of today&#39;s themers, but most are boring: ONLY TIME WILL TELL and CAST YOUR MIND BACK are just phrases. LETT HERE CORD SHOW is better, but &quot;show&quot; is a full word. TWOD RINK MINI MUMS is better. There isn&#39;t a lot, and Mr. Seigel found an impressive set.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/26/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":16},"grid":["R","O","O","M","B","A",".","T","H","A","T","S","U","C","K","S","A","M","P","L","E","R",".","H","O","L","E","I","N","O","N","E","M","A","R","K","E","T","R","E","S","E","A","R","C","H","E","R","P","R","Y",".","R","H","O","N","E",".",".",".","L","O","E","B",".",".",".","A","M","U","S","E",".","O","S","L","O",".",".",".","M","A","S","T","E","R","S","T","R","A","T","E","G","I","S","T","C","R","A","M",".",".",".",".","O","H","I","O",".","M","O","O","J","O","N",".","A","L","L","F","O","U","R","S",".","P","A","D","O","A","T",".","M","O","O","T",".",".",".",".","M","E","M","O","B","R","A","N","F","O","R","D","M","A","R","S","A","L","I","S",".",".",".","O","M","N","I",".","C","L","E","A","R",".",".",".","D","R","N","O",".",".",".","N","A","V","A","L",".","O","P","S","R","E","A","D","I","L","Y","A","V","A","I","L","A","B","L","E","A","P","P","L","I","E","S","T","O",".","R","O","D","E","I","N","M","O","S","E","I","S","L","E","Y",".","S","W","A","Y","E","D"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,0,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,24,25,26,0,0,0,0,27,28,29,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,32,33,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,39,40,41,0,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,43,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,48,49,50,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,54,55,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,58,59,60,61,0,0,0,62,63,64,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
