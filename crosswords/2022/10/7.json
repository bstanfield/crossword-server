{"title":"New York Times, Friday, October 7, 2022","author":"Mary Lou Guizzo and Jeff Chen","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/7/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Mary Lou Guizzo and Jeff Chen win the &quot;first to include KETANJI BROWN JACKSON&#39;s full name&quot; race. The new Justice was sworn in on September 30. The Andy Borowitz headline in The New Yorker was <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/ketanji-brown-jackson-bravely-infiltrates-shadowy-alt-right-group\">Ketanji Brown Jackson Bravely Infiltrates Shadowy Alt-Right Group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have yet another crossword co-constructed by Mr. Chen. I presumed he made so many with partners because he was too lazy to fill the whole grid himself, but it turns out Jeff genuinely loves team-constructing, both with established constructors like Mary Lou and with newbies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the NYT alone, Jeff has puzzles with a record <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Collabs\">51 collaborators</a>. His <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Constructors?sort=collabs\">92 crosswords</a> trails only the great <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Nancy+Salomon\">Nancy Salomon</a>, who paved the way for so many new constructors, including Wordplay queen <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Deb+Amlen\">Deb Amlen</a>. Other familiar top collaborators include <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Andrea+Carla+Michaels\">Andrea Carla Michaels</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Erik+Agard\">Erik Agard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Brad+Wilber\">Brad Wilber</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Doug+Peterson\">Doug Peterson</a> &mdash; all respected practitioners of the art. Some constructors like Erik, Brad, and <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=David+Steinberg\">David Steinberg</a> are also editors. You could argue that every puzzle they publish on their respective venues is a collaboration too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building puzzles with friends is fun, but so is solving with friends. If you&#39;re a competitive solver, you might barely remember struggling through a mid-week puzzle, bouncing ideas off someone you love, and cheering together when a tough answer breaks through, but it&#39;s a joyful activity. I don&#39;t have real data, but I suspect most solvers work with others. Try it yourself if you&#39;re used to struggling on your own. Or even if not.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/7/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["Z","E","B","R","A",".",".","C","L","E","A","V","A","G","E","A","P","R","O","N","S",".","H","A","N","G","E","R","O","N","I","S","A","W","I","T",".","E","S","T","E","E","M","E","D","R","O","V","E",".","O","F","F","S",".",".","R","A","S","P","E","M","E","R","A","L","D",".","O","M","G",".","D","A","L",".",".",".",".","K","E","R","R",".","A","T","T","I","L","A",".","K","E","T","A","N","J","I",".","C","O","O","L","L","Y","B","O","G","O",".","B","R","O","W","N",".","E","L","I","S","A","N","G","O","R","A",".","J","A","C","K","S","O","N",".","C","A","B","L","E","S",".","A","S","H","E",".",".",".",".","I","C","E",".","D","E","F",".","T","E","A","S","H","O","P","L","O","A","M",".",".","E","P","E","E",".","T","U","B","A","L","A","T","E","G","A","M","E",".","S","H","A","M","E","S","U","S","E","R","N","A","M","E",".","E","I","L","I","S","H","S","T","R","E","U","S","E","L",".",".","M","E","D","E","A"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,0,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,25,26,27,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,30,0,31,0,32,0,0,0,0,33,34,35,0,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,39,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,43,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,49,0,50,0,0,51,52,53,54,55,0,0,56,0,0,57,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,61,62,0,0,0,63,64,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1. &quot;How fast does a ___ have to run before it looks gray?&quot;: Demetri Martin","6.
