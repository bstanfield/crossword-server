{"title":"New York Times, Thursday, October 20, 2022","author":"Rebecca Goldstein","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/20/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who is taking swimming lessons at THE Y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many ways Thursday constructors can twist the standard rules. Here are some popular violations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Rebus\">Rebus</a> entries (more than one letter in a box)</li>\r\n\t<li>Answers entered <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Backwards\">backward*</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Writing <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Floats\">outside the grid</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Writing <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/BlockText\">inside blocks*</a> (black squares)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>1 and 2 are well supported whether you solve electronically or on paper. No. 3 doesn&#39;t work well in an app, but paper solvers have no problem. No. 4 is unique in that, no matter how you solve, there&#39;s no good way to scribble inside already black squares. This makes people cranky. (We get mail.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" class=\"right\" src=\"https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/60/34/44/240_F_60344467_G28vR8fFOSMfH4vl37giiZjpYr0dfNdm.jpg\" style=\"border:none; width:286px\" title=\"I'm different\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>To overcome this solver reticence, you at least need a solid justification. Today&#39;s BLACK SHEEP works. Liz Gorski turned all her consecutive black squares into <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/20/2011\">BARs</a>. We&#39;ve had a Solar <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/4/2012\">ECLIPSE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=12/1/2013\">BACK</a> in Black, black <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/5/2017\">JACK</a>, black <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=5/4/2017\">ICE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/BlockText\">etc</a>. Jeff Chen did one with black <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/27/2013\">CATS</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you love these puzzles or consider this nonsense an unforgivable sin? Perhaps it&#39;s a case of MORAL AMBIGUITY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disclaimer: I was curious how often these various gimmicks occurred. The two starred links above are newly created for this post, and it&#39;s likely neither is complete. Let me know if one of your favorites is missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS: What are the answers that hide LAMB, assuming you don&#39;t want it at either the beginning or end of the word? <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=*?LAMB?*\">Here are the ones we know of</a>.
