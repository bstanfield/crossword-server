Some answers peek out the top. You have to raise oBJECTIONS, raise a sTINK, raise the mINIMUM WAGE, and raise a fAMILY to make the clues make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Down below, you have to lower the VOLUMe, lower the TEMPERATURe, and lower the PRICe to fit the clues. And finally, in a bit of classic crossword humor, you have to please, for God&#39;s sake, for once in your life, lower the damn TOILET SEAt. (On the other hand, it bugs the heck out of me that some thoughtless people leave the seat down, which is just so very inconvenient!

One option is to color outside the lines. Today&#39;s example was brave because there&#39;s no explicit revealer, like <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/7/2019&amp;g=58&amp;d=A\">GO OVER THE EDGE</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/7/2016&amp;g=34&amp;d=A\">DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=4/1/2006&amp;g=39&amp;d=A\">THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=5/16/2013&amp;g=51&amp;d=A\">MAN OVERBOARD</a>.
