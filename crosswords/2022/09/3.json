{"title":"New York Times, Saturday, September 3, 2022","author":"David Distenfeld","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"9/3/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who is participating in Zener card experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My impression is that Rudyard Kipling isn&#39;t taught so much in school anymore, at least in America. You&#39;ll know he wrote <em>The Jungle Book</em> and the<em> Just So Stories</em>, but he was also an influential poet. <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46782/danny-deever\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">DANNY Deever</a> is about soldiers watching the execution by hanging of one of their own. It sticks with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, lots of people die in ROGUE ONE at 50-Across, and it&#39;s not sad at all. The only good Storm Trooper is a dead Storm Trooper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clue of the day is &quot;Lead-in to hickey,&quot; which, as luck would have it, crosses DIRTY MINDED.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now I&#39;m going to kill your joy. <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/1/1998&amp;g=109&amp;d=D\">DOO has been clued similarly before</a> by the great Merl Reagle, who called it a &quot;Prelude to a hickey.&quot; That brings me to a complaint I sometimes hear: XWord Info is bad for crosswords because it makes it too easy to surface prior art that nobody would otherwise remember. Pointing out repeated themes or clues is pointlessly pedantic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s another big complaint people have about this site which I&#39;ll share in a future post. Perhaps you can guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I leave you with this cringy Blast from the Past courtesy of 18-Across.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:75.00%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_9LKmITloc\"></iframe></div>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/3/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["S","S","H","A","P","E",".",".",".","D","O","E","S","N","T","H","E","Y","D","A","Y",".",".","R","A","P","S","T","A","R","E","X","P","O","S","E",".","M","A","N","I","P","E","D","I","L","I","N",".","S","U","Z","A","N","N","E",".","P","I","X","B","L","O","C",".","P","O","R","K","Y",".","S","I","R","I","Y","E","S","E","S",".","O","R","A",".","R","I","N","S","E",".","D","I","R","T","Y","M","I","N","D","E","D",".",".",".",".",".","S","T","E","A","M","E","D","O","P","E","N",".",".",".",".",".","A","R","M","E","D","F","O","R","C","E","S",".","U","N","P","I","N",".","E","L","I",".","O","A","T","H","S","S","O","O","N",".","A","T","I","L","T",".","R","Y","A","N","U","M","P",".","H","E","I","F","E","R","S",".","I","D","O","R","O","G","U","E","O","N","E",".","I","A","T","E","I","T","P","R","U","N","I","N","G",".",".","A","M","U","L","E","T","S","E","N","O","R","S",".",".",".","L","E","T","D","R","Y"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,0,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,21,0,0,22,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,26,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,36,37,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,42,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,44,0,45,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,49,0,0,50,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,53,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
