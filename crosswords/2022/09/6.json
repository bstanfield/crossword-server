The <strong>IJI</strong> pattern is tough, so we might not get anything useful, but maybe we&#39;ll learn some useful techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Jeff already did the basic search for <span class=\"nowrap\"><a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=*IJI*\">*IJI*</a></span> but it&#39;s often a good idea to <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?dm=FQSwVixA\">try that same pattern with the OneLook button</a> since it uses a different database. Any chance you could use <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?dm=M4CwlgVmCGBeIFdoDsDmQ\">Shijiazhuang</a> or <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?dm=NYCwhgTglgVlAuBTAzkA\">Kharijites</a>? Probably not, but worth trying.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff wants answers with some combination of three I and J letters, but <em>not</em> the boring III. For that, we need RegEx. Let&#39;s break it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Letters in square brackets means use any of them, so <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?regex=[IJ]\">[IJ] finds any words with either an I or a J</a>. Nearly half a million results, but it&#39;s a start.</li>\r\n\t<li>Numbers in curly brackets means repeat that the specified number of times, so <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?regex=[IJ]{3}\"><span class=\"nowrap\">[IJ]{3}</span> finds words with three letters in a row that are either I or J</a>. It&#39;s the equivalent of Jeff&#39;s <a class=\"nowrap\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=*[IJ][IJ][IJ]*\">*[IJ][IJ][IJ]*</a> and it has the same problem &mdash; those boring <strong>III</strong> words we&#39;d like to exclude.</li>\r\n\t<li>Exclusion requires something called a negative lookahead that we haven&#39;t talked about before. Put what you don&#39;t want to see between <span class=\"nowrap\"><strong>(?!</strong> and <strong>)</strong></span>. Using that, our final query is <span class=\"nowrap\"><a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?regex=(?!III)[IJ]{3}\">(?!III)[IJ]{3}</a>.</span></li>\r\n</ul>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Tuesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/6/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["S","O","D","A",".","B","R","A","T",".",".","G","O","S","H","I","N","O","N",".","A","H","M","A","D",".","I","C","E","E","K","E","N","T",".","S","E","I","J","I","O","Z","A","W","A","H","I","J","I","N","K","S",".",".","D","A","M","N","E","D","I","O","U",".","I","S","U","Z","U",".","R","O","A","D","S","S","T","A","R","T",".","S","E","N","D","S",".","D","O","E","M","A","N","O","R","S",".","R","I","A",".","P","A","N","T",".",".",".","D","O","T","D","O","T","D","O","T",".",".",".","F","E","T","E",".","A","A","S",".","A","M","A","L","F","I","A","L","E",".","E","N","N","U","I",".","A","S","I","A","N","L","O","M","A","X",".","A","M","M","A","N",".","M","I","A","A","P","P","L","E","S",".",".","B","E","I","J","I","N","G","F","I","J","I","D","O","L","L","A","R",".","O","T","T","O","E","N","O","S",".","D","I","S","C","I",".","K","E","E","N","L","G","B","T",".",".","D","U","K","E",".","E","D","D","Y"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,0,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,15,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,25,26,0,27,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,29,0,0,30,0,0,31,0,0,32,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,34,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,40,41,42,0,0,43,0,0,0,44,0,0,45,46,47,48,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,50,0,51,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,53,0,0,54,0,0,55,0,0,56,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,59,0,0,60,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,62,63,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,0,70,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
