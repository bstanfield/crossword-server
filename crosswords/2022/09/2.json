{"title":"New York Times, Friday, September 2, 2022","author":"Claire Rimkus","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2022, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"9/2/2022","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Jim here, sitting in for Jeff Chen, who is high in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://www.birdlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Hummingbird-Norbert-Hentges-Unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg\" style=\"width:623px\" title=\"Hummingbirds are amazing\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Themeless crossword constructors think hard about their 1-Across answer the same way novelists deliberate over their opening sentence &mdash; they want it to shine, to entice, to be memorable. Not every first answer will be &quot;Call me Ishmael,&quot; or &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,&quot; or &quot;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dDjeuK\">I was born twice</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s 1-Across is pedestrian: ESTATE LAW. So, what&#39;s a constructor to do? Give it an outstanding clue. &quot;Subject of some family planning&quot; sends your brain off in the wrong direction. Plus, it hints at sex. (Just me?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And speaking of sex, when did HOOKED UP start to imply a coital connection? It used to be such an anodyne phrase. And AMBI gets a sex clue at 8-Down. Maleska would be aghast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;2003 search-and-rescue target&quot; is a great clue for NEMO, and because of my Y-chromosome bias, it took me a while to see &quot;Clutch, e.g.&quot; as PURSE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s a tip for working out short words in themeless puzzles. Most short answers have been so overused that obvious clues have long ago been worn out. &quot;Nwodim of S.N.L.&quot; is tough if, like me, you haven&#39;t watched that skit show since the early 50s, but there&#39;s a good chance that, even though the clue might mean nothing, the answer is a word you&#39;ve seen many times before. Alternatively, it&#39;s a nice EGO boost if you knew that one right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ah, Ms. Hilson. Her name is KERI. Don&#39;t hate her &#39;cause she&#39;s beautiful.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:56.29%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtXOVKNazYU\"></iframe></div>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/2/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["E","S","T","A","T","E","L","A","W",".",".","I","R","A","N","C","L","O","S","E","G","A","M","E","S",".","N","E","M","O","C","A","R","T","R","O","U","B","L","E",".","H","A","U","T","O","W","N","E","R",".","G","I","L","L",".","E","L","S","E",".",".",".","R","A","S","H",".",".","F","R","A","M","E","D","S","I","N","S",".","A","T","O","P",".","A","V","A",".",".","W","O","O",".","P","U","R","S","E",".","P","E","T","A","L","A","T","T","H","E","L","A","S","T","M","I","N","U","T","E","G","A","B","O","N",".","C","I","T","E","D",".","R","O","T",".",".","Y","O","N",".","K","E","R","I",".","G","E","M","S","S","N","A","K","E","D",".",".","A","N","D","Y",".",".",".","T","I","M","E",".","A","C","T","I",".","A","M","M","A","N","R","E","I","D",".","W","H","E","N","I","N","R","O","M","E","A","C","L","U",".","N","A","M","E","D","N","A","M","E","S","P","E","E","P",".",".","S","P","R","A","Y","T","A","N","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,0,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,23,0,0,0,24,25,0,0,0,0,26,27,28,0,0,29,0,30,31,0,32,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,36,37,38,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,47,48,0,0,0,49,0,0,50,0,51,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,54,55,0,0,56,0,57,58,59,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
