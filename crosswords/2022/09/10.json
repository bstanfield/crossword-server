There&#39;s the outstanding black blues singer SISTA <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=717aFbEBKCs\">Monica</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GWGIcGUc4o\">Parker</a>, the Cherokee Oscar winner <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Studi\">WES Studi</a>, and a non-mainstream religion. (ZEUS!) OPRAH is a visible minority, but she hasn&#39;t been underrepresented since people were talking about her in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LEN BARRY was the lead singer of the Dovells (accent on the second syllable), and he&#39;s as white as they come. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An1-ntyBcz8\">Here he is singing &quot;1-2-3&quot;</a> (the song in the clue) but check out the video of <em>The Bristol Stomp</em>. Note the homogeneous audience members, decked out in their finest. Is this the era that Make America Great Again wants to recapture?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:75.06%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCOB5-E4P6Y\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Diversity is about more than cultural differences. Crosswords traditionally expect a college-level familiarity with English Literature and Western History, but don&#39;t expect me to do math or science! You might have to dig back into 10th Grade Physics to remember the IDEAL GAS LAW, but it&#39;s no more obscure than that opera singer or rapper or Lord Byron poem that you love. By the way, it&#39;s the gas that&#39;s ideal (meaning theoretical), not the law, which is only an approximation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the clue &quot;Big sponsor of golf, sailing, tennis, motorsport and equestrian events.&quot; There&#39;s no way to guess the answer. Yes, there is! Those events all point to the well-heeled. ROLEX it is, then.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/10/2022","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["A","D","V","E","R","B",".",".",".","M","I","M","I","C","S","S","U","I","T","O","R",".",".","B","O","N","E","D","U","P","S","O","M","A","L","I",".","L","O","O","K","H","E","R","E",".",".",".","L","E","N","B","A","R","R","Y",".","A","T","E","M","A","R",".","X","G","A","M","E","S",".","C","L","A","D","I","M","A","Y",".","I","N","A","T",".","A","E","G","I","S","N","O","N","E",".","T","A","Z","O",".","B","L","A","N","K","T","U","G","O","N",".","N","E","T",".","S","I","S","T","A","C","R","E","M","A",".","A","C","E","S",".","A","L","I","T","O","P","R","A","H",".","P","L","A","N",".","C","A","M","E","I","R","O","N",".","B","E","A","R","O","N",".","W","E","S","N","O","V",".","P","R","E","S","S","B","O","X",".",".",".","S","P","E","C","I","A","L","S",".","A","D","O","R","E","D","E","R","R","A","N","D","S",".",".","L","U","X","U","R","Y","T","E","S","L","A","S",".",".",".","L","H","O","T","S","E"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,0,0,0,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,20,21,22,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,25,0,0,26,0,27,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,33,0,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,38,0,39,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,45,0,46,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,50,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,53,54,55,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
