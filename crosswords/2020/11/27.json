{"title":"NY Times, Fri, Nov 27, 2020","author":"Robyn Weintraub","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2020, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"11/27/2020","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>CFLAT is a <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=CFLAT\">tough word to clue</a>. There are no famous orchestral works in that key. It&#39;s the enharmonic equivalent of B Major (five sharps), so there&#39;s no obvious reason to go to the trouble of writing music in C Flat (seven flats.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Weintraub&#39;s clue is &quot;Harpist&#39;s home key.&quot; That&#39;s brilliant, and it&#39;s mostly true, especially for modern Concert Harps, the kind you see in orchestras. It does raise the question, why are harps tuned to such an awkward key?</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpo_Marx\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"center\" src=\"/images/bonus/Harpo.png\" style=\"width:626px\" title=\"Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking ...\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand, you need to know how harps work. There are seven strings per octave (like the seven white keys on a piano), the strings are color-coded according to their letter names, and there are pedals that stretch the strings, altering their pitch, but only in one direction &mdash; sharp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the strings all start in C Flat (all seven notes in the scale are flat.) Pushing, say, the D pedal and locking it down causes all the Ds to rise to D natural. Another notch down, and they all sound as D sharp. Correctly positioning all seven pedals allows you to play in any key and keep the color-to-note-name mapping consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you started in, say, C instead of C flat, you could still play in any sharp key (G, D, A, etc.), but playing in a flat key (F, B flat, etc.) would require you to drop down to a different (now raised) string. That messes up the color mapping, but critically, it would make that string unavailable for the correct note in whatever key you&#39;re in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"pullquote\">Why don&#39;t harps have 12 strings per octave</span> so every possible note could be played in any key<span class=\"pullquote\">?</span> For one thing, harps already have so many strings it&#39;s difficult to keep track of them all. More importantly, you&#39;d lose the ability for harps to do that effect they&#39;re most famous for &mdash; the glissandos where strings are strummed to make that familiar shimmering effect. That only works if the notes blend because they&#39;re all in one key or one chord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun fact: Harpo Marx, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teaZMUmFEas&amp;pbjreload=102\">who played beautifully</a>, didn&#39;t use a C Flat home key or any normal scale. He had his own unique tuning scheme &mdash; not surprising given that he was completely self-taught.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=11/27/2020","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["A","M","O","N","G",".",".","I","G","A",".","A","S","A","P","P","O","K","E","R",".","F","O","O","L",".","D","U","L","L","S","T","O","N","E","H","E","N","G","E",".","B","R","I","O","E","E","K","A","M","O","U","S","E",".","B","L","E","E","P",".",".",".",".","L","S","D",".","T","H","R","O","W","N",".","C","A","R","R","I","E","S","A","T","O","R","C","H",".",".","A","R","I","A","N","A",".","L","E","G",".","K","Y","L","O","L","E","N","D","S",".","H","E","R",".","T","E","N","A","M","M","A","G","I",".","M","I","X",".","C","O","R","O","N","A",".",".","B","A","N","A","N","A","S","F","O","S","T","E","R",".","S","E","L","E","C","T",".","I","L","L",".",".",".",".","S","T","A","T","E",".","H","U","L","A","S","K","I","R","T","N","O","R","I",".","B","I","L","L","T","H","E","C","A","T","O","V","E","R",".","A","N","T","S",".","E","N","E","M","Y","W","E","R","E",".","M","T","A",".",".","D","O","R","A","L"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,0,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,22,23,0,0,0,0,0,24,25,26,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,31,0,32,33,34,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,46,47,0,0,0,48,49,50,51,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1. ___ others","6.
