Rinks are rectangular with rounded corners. Their opposite sides are parallel straight edges. Ovals are nothing like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, more or less. Crossword clues, especially later-week ones, have this strange balance where sometimes absolute parsing precision is required &mdash; is &quot;flower&quot; a plant or a river? &mdash; and other times, over-generalization is the key. Both approaches are designed to fool you, which is the point of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ELLIPSE would be clearly wrong, right? OVAL is more mushily defined. And since English dictionaries are famously descriptive rather than prescriptive, if &quot;people&quot; call rinks oval, then they&#39;re oval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much hair has been yanked over these sorts of details. As a solver, you can either choose to be annoyed or amused. You&#39;ll have plenty of company in either camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My opinion on this particular clue: I don&#39;t like it. I realize, though, that I&#39;d likely live a longer, more enjoyable life if I just went with the flow-er.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Thursday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=8/13/2020","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["S","P","F",".","W","R","E","N","C","H",".","H","A","M","S","A","R","A",".","H","O","N","O","R","E",".","A","M","O","I","F","O","N","E","I","N","G","R","O","C","K","Z","A","L","L","A","S","T","E","R",".",".",".","W","H","E","E","L","I","E","R","H","A","L","L","V","O","N","E","E","Y",".","G","E","N","I","O","S",".","S","E","V","E","R",".","S","T","A","R","T","S","P","Y","S",".","G","A","T",".","S","I","M","M","E","R",".",".",".","P","H","A","L","L","C","O","N","E",".",".",".","A","D","R","I","A","N",".","O","A","R",".","N","O","M","O","P","O","E","T","S",".","M","S","N","B","C",".","N","A","N","O","L","A",".","S","L","Y","S","T","O","N","E","A","L","L","S","P","I","L","L","I","T",".",".",".","O","N","L","A","Y","T","H","R","E","E","M","U","S","K","E","T","E","E","R","S","L","I","E","N",".","B","R","A","I","S","E",".","R","I","O","E","N","D","S",".","O","N","Y","X","E","S",".","T","A","N"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,0,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,23,24,25,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,29,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,32,0,33,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,36,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,38,39,40,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,43,44,45,46,0,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,49,0,0,50,0,0,0,51,52,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,54,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,58,59,60,0,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0],"circles":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
