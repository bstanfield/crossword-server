I&#39;ll never forget it. On my first trip to the UK, I hired (not rented) a car in London and drove it all the way to a fishing town on the north coast of Scotland to meet a shirt-tail relative. The further north you go in Scotland, and the further you travel from large cities, the stronger and more incomprehensible the accent becomes. By the time I got to Buckie, I could barely pick out a word per sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My directions in town were spotty, so I stopped the car to ask a boy on the street how to get to the Council House that I knew was close to my destination. &quot;De ya nae ken Buckie?&quot; he asked. This much I understood. I explained I was a visitor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Aye, then, well ya see the wee quinie doon the brae?&quot; I was at a complete loss. The young loonie (boy) was frustrated with my stupidity but I eventually came to understand that a quinie was a girl and doon the brae was down the hill. I think of that story with great pleasure every time BRAE pops up in a grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of your own life adventures, you know plenty of obscure things that most people nae ken. I bet each time you encounter one in a grid, it makes you smile.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/23/2020","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["P","A","N","E","L",".","M","I","M","I",".","A","P","B","S","A","S","I","D","E",".","E","V","E","R",".","L","S","A","T","T","A","K","E","A","B","R","E","A","K",".","L","O","N","E","S","H","O","R","T","L","I","S","T",".","F","O","R","K",".","Y","I","N",".","H","O","T",".",".","A","R","T","I","S","T",".",".",".","C","E","O",".","A","C","N","E",".","A","H","A",".",".","W","O","R","D","P","R","O","C","E","S","S","O","R",".","P","I","N","S","T","R","I","P","E","S","U","I","T",".","F","A","K","E","E","Y","E","L","A","S","H","E","S",".",".","C","P","I",".","A","P","P","S",".","T","I","S",".",".",".","C","A","P","O","T","E",".",".","C","O","P",".","A","K","A",".","B","E","D","S",".","S","T","A","R","P","O","W","E","R","R","E","D","O",".","R","I","S","K","S","I","T","A","L","L","P","A","I","R",".","B","R","A","E",".","N","O","I","S","E","I","R","A","S",".","G","I","R","D",".","G","E","T","O","N"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,27,28,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,42,43,0,44,0,0,0,0,45,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
