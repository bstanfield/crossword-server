The number before it (5) must be odd because there are no consecutive evens, so the next number, the sum of those two, the sum of an even and an odd (5+8), must also be odd (13.) Continue to the number after that. It must be odd too because it&#39;s the sum of the previous odd number (13) plus the one before that (which must be even, in this example, 8.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, we have the sum of two odd numbers, which is even, and the odd-odd-even cycle repeats.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/28/2020","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":16},"grid":["T","R","I","C","K","Y",".","T","O","P","S",".","T","S","A","R","R","E","M","O","V","E",".","O","B","O","E",".","H","U","R","T","I","M","A","R","E","T",".","M","I","K","E","P","E","N","C","E","C","O","M","P","L","I","C","A","T","E","D","A","N","D",".",".","E","R","A",".","L","S","A","T",".",".",".","I","C","E","A","X",".","A","C","R","E",".","Y","O","U","R","E","N","E","V","E","R",".",".",".","O","D","D",".",".","Z","A","P","S",".","I","R","A","G","A","B","E",".","D","E","F","I","N","E",".","C","L","O","Y","E","G","O",".","F","A","L","L",".",".","E","M","U",".",".",".","R","E","A","L","L","Y","S","U","R","E",".","A","R","F","S",".","M","E","T","O","O",".",".",".","E","T","T","U",".","O","P","S",".",".","Y","O","U","G","O","T","T","H","E","R","I","G","H","T","T","R","A","T","T","O","R","I","A",".","S","E","A","B","E","E","S","O","R","E",".","L","E","V","I",".","L","E","N","O","R","E","K","I","D","D",".","F","O","O","L",".","A","N","S","W","E","R"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,0,7,8,9,10,0,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,26,27,0,28,0,29,0,0,30,0,31,32,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,35,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,38,39,40,0,0,41,42,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,47,48,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,51,52,0,53,0,54,55,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,58,0,0,59,0,60,0,0,61,0,0,62,63,64,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,66,67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,0,70,0,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,0,72,0,0,0,0,73,0,0,0,0,74,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
