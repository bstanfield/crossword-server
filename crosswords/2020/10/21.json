I&#39;ve only heard KAN, even when I was there. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes\">Wikipedia</a> agrees with me (French: kan.) <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cannes\">Merriam Webster</a> agrees with me (preferred pronunciation kan, but to be fair, also accepts k&auml;n.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case closed? Maybe if you&#39;re a Parisian, but in France, the further south you go, and the closer you get to Italy, the more people tend to follow the Italian tradition of pronouncing every vowel. Cannes is right on the Mediterranean, very close to Italy. This native speaker adds the very French sort-of &quot;uh&quot; semi-vowel. So, we&#39;re both wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"YouTube-container\" style=\"padding-top:56.30%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vI_bPlwjkY8\"></iframe></div>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/21/2020","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["B","E","E","F",".","P","H","O","B","I","A",".","L","I","E","A","G","R","A",".","B","A","R","U","C","H",".","O","C","T","B","E","R","N","B","R","I","D","G","E","S",".","C","A","R","U","S","O","F","A",".","M","E","L",".",".","C","A","N","E",".","T","R","I","B","E",".","R","E","D","E","A","L","T",".",".",".",".","C","A","N","N","E","S","O","P","E","N","E","R","G","T","E",".",".","H","A","D",".","G","E","N","E","V","A","R","E","V",".","D","A","B",".","E","S","E",".","W","E","I","A","L","I","S","O","N",".","K","O","I",".",".","S","N","L","D","E","L","H","I","C","O","U","N","T","E","R",".",".",".",".","T","W","O","T","E","R","M",".","S","L","E","W","S",".","I","H","O","P",".",".","I","Q","S",".","S","T","O","O","P","M","O","M",".","S","E","O","U","L","S","E","A","R","C","H","U","N","A",".","A","U","L","A","I","T",".","I","M","H","O","S","S","N",".","P","R","E","T","T","Y",".","L","Y","I","N"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,9,10,0,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,25,0,26,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,31,32,33,0,0,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,40,0,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,47,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,50,51,0,52,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,54,0,55,0,0,0,56,57,0,0,0,58,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
