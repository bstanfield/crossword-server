{"title":"VOWEL PLAY","author":"David Steinberg","editor":"","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"1/7/2018","notepad":"In the print version of this puzzle, the squares that are circled are instead each divided into two halves with a diagonal line.","jnotes":"<p>This is only the fifth time diagonal slashes have been used in NYT daily crosswords. The first was <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=5/31/1992&amp;g=126&amp;d=A\">this 1992 Crytocrossword</a> by Eugene T. Maleska himself which included the awesome word SPLACKNUCKS, followed by <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=8/9/1992\">this Tic-Tac-Toe grid</a> by S. E. Booker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before today, the only two in the Shortz Era were <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/1/1995\">this New Year&#39;s puzzle by Henry Hook</a> in 1995, and a tricky 2011 Trip Payne puzzle called <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=11/20/2011\">Figure It Out</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We added helpful slashes to a couple of grids to explain themes, but those slashes didn&#39;t appear in print. In 2012, Ian Livengood pulled a clever trick with <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/5/2012\">keyboard digits and their shift-key equivalents</a>. Just a few weeks after that, Joel Fagliano tried to confuse us with his <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/26/2012\">W vs. double-U grid</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Added geeky note:</strong> David Steinberg mentioned <em>Regular Expressions</em>, which is as a way to do complex word pattern searches. And yes, of course, the <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder\">XWord Info Finder Page</a> supports them!</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Sunday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=1/7/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":true,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":21,"cols":21},"grid":["J","U","L",".","S","P","A","S",".",".",".","S","M","A","R","M",".","C","O","R","A","U","N","I",".","T","O","R","T","A",".","L","O","A","D","E","R",".","A","P","E","X","D","EA","AI","L","AY","M","EA","AI","L",".","A","N","N","A","L","S",".","R","I","D","E","A","S","S","E","S","S",".","D","I","E","M",".","S","P","IE","C","YI","F","OI","OE","D","H","Y","E","N","A",".",".",".","T","R","I","J","E","T","S",".","K","I","D","S",".",".",".",".","I","T","O",".","S","T","I","N","E",".","S","U","M","E","R",".",".",".","D","A","M","N",".","F","OU","UE","L","C","AE","L","L",".","P","O","S","E","D","A","S","E","L","IA","S",".","A","T","S","E","A",".","L","I","P","O","S",".","S","AU","L","T","V","A","N","T","A","G","E",".",".",".",".",".","M","I","N","E","D",".","N","B","A",".",".","T","O","R","E","A","T",".","S","A","T","I","N",".","S","U","B","G","U","M","W","H","OA","M","I",".","T","R","IA","C","K","S","T","EA","R",".","P","R","EA","M","P","H","E","R","B","A","L",".","A","M","I","C","A",".","L","A","G","E","A","R",".",".","E","L","EA",".","S","A","H","I","B",".",".",".",".",".","R","A","D","I","OE","R","A","L","L","OY","D",".","C","A","N","I","T",".","I","R","W","I","N",".","D","UE","I","N","P","O","S","I","T","E","D",".","C","H","OA","C","H","AI","N","G",".","E","S","P","N",".",".",".","G","O","Y","A","S",".","E","T","H","E","L",".","S","A","D",".",".",".",".","T","R","I","G",".","G","A","I","N","S","O","N",".",".",".","T","R","A","I","T","W","H","AI","T","AE","T","OA","OI","L",".","E","R","I","S",".","L","A","U","N","C","H","H","E","L","I",".","S","T","R","O","B","E",".","S","T","R","IO","N","G","T","IE","EA","A","T","O","Z",".","K","I","S","S","E","D",".","H","O","U","N","D",".","E","S","S","M","A","N","E",".","S","T","E","E","D",".",".",".","P","E","S","T",".","S","T","P"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,0,4,5,6,7,0,0,0,8,9,10,11,12,0,13,14,15,16,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,22,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,28,0,0,29,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,36,0,37,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,41,42,0,0,43,44,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,46,0,0,0,47,48,49,50,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,53,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,58,0,59,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,62,63,64,0,0,0,65,0,66,0,0,0,67,68,0,0,0,0,69,0,70,0,0,0,0,0,71,0,72,0,0,0,0,73,0,0,0,0,74,0,75,0,0,0,0,0,76,0,77,0,0,0,0,0,78,0,0,0,79,0,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,81,0,0,0,0,82,83,84,0,0,85,0,86,0,0,0,87,0,88,89,90,0,0,0,91,0,0,0,92,0,0,0,93,0,0,0,94,0,95,0,0,0,0,0,0,96,0,0,0,0,0,0,97,0,0,0,98,0,99,0,0,0,0,0,100,101,0,0,0,0,0,102,103,0,0,0,104,0,105,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,106,0,107,108,109,110,0,0,0,0,111,0,0,0,0,112,0,0,113,0,114,0,0,0,0,0,115,0,0,0,0,116,0,0,0,117,0,0,118,0,119,0,0,0,0,0,0,120,0,0,0,0,121,0,0,0,0,0,0,122,0,0,0,0,0,123,0,0,124,0,0,0,0,125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,126,0,0,0,0,127,0,0],"circles":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
