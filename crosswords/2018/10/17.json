{"title":"NY Times, Wed, Oct 17, 2018","author":"Patrick Blindauer and Tony Orbach","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/17/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge famously coined the phrase &quot;suspension of disbelief.&quot; You can&#39;t enjoy fiction without it. You can&#39;t enjoy <em>any</em> art without it. Art and Nature are two different things; non-overlapping magisteria. <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/23/2018\">A painting of a pipe is not a pipe</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/images/bonus/Pancakes.jpg\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bonus/Pancakes.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:152px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px\" title=\"Delicious!\" /></a>To me, a triple stack of PANCAKEs on a PLATE with a PAT of butter on top and syrup dripping down the sides all within a 15x15 block of black-and-white squares full of fun words is close to miraculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossword commentary decrying the lack of accuracy in grid images confounds me. Of course, this breakfast isn&#39;t exactly what you find at IHOP. Jeff complained last September that the chemical bonds represented <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/18/2018\">in this puzzle</a> didn&#39;t show the correct angles, and that <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=7/31/2017\">last year&#39;s Space Needle</a> didn&#39;t have quite the right dimensions. Of course not. Use your imagination. It&#39;s fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a software company I used to work for, I got to know some of the artists who created icons. It&#39;s a crazy, specialized skill to make something so small represent something recognizable, but they had a couple of advantages over constructors &mdash; even at the smallest size of 32x32 pixels, that&#39;s four and a half times the number of squares available in today&#39;s puzzle, and they got to take advantage of subtle color tricks to fool the eye into seeing detail and dimensionality that wasn&#39;t really there. Crossword art is necessarily more primitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, and this might seem unfair, I seem to recall a Christmas puzzle last year by <a class=\"hasphoto\" href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Mary+Lou+Guizzo\">Mary Lou Guizzo</a> and her collaborator. Who was that again? Oh, right, it was Jeff. Call me crazy, but I&#39;ve never encountered a <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=12/24/2017\">reindeer that looked exactly like this</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff and I love to argue crosswords. Now and then, one of us even manages to change the other&#39;s mind. It&#39;s fun either way.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/17/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["M","A","G","I","C",".","P","A","T",".","J","O","I","N","S","I","C","A","L","L",".","E","S","E",".","U","B","O","A","T","T","E","S","L","A",".","N","I","X",".","V","I","N","N","Y","T","S","P",".","P","A","N","C","A","K","E",".","S","A","X",".",".",".","S","T","A","Y","S","S","A","N","E",".",".",".",".",".","A","U","R","A","L",".","F","A","I","T","H",".",".","S","C","U","B","A",".","A","O","L",".","L","O","U","I","S","H","E","N",".","P","A","N","C","A","K","E",".","N","N","E","E","S","T","A",".","L","E","D","G","E",".","H","G","T","V","S","T","J","U","D","E",".",".",".","G","U","E","R","R","E","A","L","E","X","A",".","S","A","S",".","T","R","Y","O","N","L","A","M",".","P","A","N","C","A","K","E",".","J","U","S","A","V","I","D",".","S","E","E","Y","A",".","R","A","B","E","D","I","M","E",".","A","L","L","I","N",".","U","C","L","A","Y","E","A","R",".","P","L","A","T","E",".","E","K","E","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,29,0,0,30,31,0,0,0,0,32,33,0,0,34,0,0,35,36,37,0,0,0,38,39,0,0,0,40,0,0,41,0,0,42,0,0,43,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,48,49,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,51,52,53,0,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,56,57,0,0,0,58,0,0,59,0,0,60,0,0,61,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
