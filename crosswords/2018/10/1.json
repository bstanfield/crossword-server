{"title":"NY Times, Mon, Oct 01, 2018","author":"Chuck Deodene","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/1/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Arrau\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Claudio_Arrau_1_Allan_Warren.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:210px\" title=\"Claudio Arrau\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crosswords are an unusual puzzle type because your experience as a solver depends so much on your life experience. Bloggers and other crossword commentators have to be careful with their &quot;this puzzle is running on the wrong day of the week&quot; objections. It&#39;s a normal tendency to assume that &quot;stuff I don&#39;t know isn&#39;t common knowledge&quot; but that&#39;s a trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you grow up loving Shakespeare, DRAMATIS PERSONAE is a gimme. If you love classical music, Claudio ARRAU drops right in. This puzzle is too easy for a Monday!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, wait a second. 51-Across asks me about some random stupid American college team? How is anyone supposed to know that stuff? Put this disaster of a puzzle on Saturday where it belongs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, though, FIGHTING ILLINI is the kind of answer I love. I didn&#39;t know the term, but it&#39;s inferable enough. Once you parse the theme and when enough crossing letters drop into place, it seems correct. It may well have been a gimme for you. That&#39;s how this game goes.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Monday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/1/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":16},"grid":["L","A","P","D",".",".","A","F","L","A","C",".","S","W","A","B","A","R","E","A","S",".","M","I","A","M","I",".","M","I","C","E","D","R","A","M","A","T","I","S","P","E","R","S","O","N","A","E","E","A","R",".","H","I","G","H",".",".","C","O","R","G","I","S","S","U","L","T","A","N","O","F","B","R","U","N","E","I",".",".",".",".",".","I","R","T",".","R","O","O","S",".","S","N","U","B","S","U","N","D","A","E",".","Y","A","W",".",".",".","G","R","O","T","H","E","E","N","D",".",".",".",".","I","S","N","I","G","H","A","N","A",".",".",".","D","O","H",".","N","E","A","T","E","R","G","O","R","P",".","S","O","B","A",".","L","X","I",".",".",".",".",".","F","I","G","H","T","I","N","G","I","L","L","I","N","I","A","S","A","S","E","T",".",".","G","E","N","E",".","X","E","R","B","A","T","T","L","E","O","F","T","H","E","S","I","N","A","I","L","M","A","O",".","T","R","U","E","R",".","S","O","A","R","S","Y","E","L","L",".","L","E","N","N","Y",".",".","N","Y","S","E"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,0,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,15,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,26,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,0,31,32,33,34,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39,40,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,43,44,45,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,48,0,49,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,54,55,56,57,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,62,63,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,0,0,0,70,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
