{"title":"MIND THE GAP","author":"Tom McCoy","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/7/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>RATSO is a surprisingly common crossword answer; this is its <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=RATSO\">53rd appearance in the Times</a>. Surprising both because Midnight Cowboy came out nearly 50 years ago, and because there&#39;s no way to clue the word without reference to that film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;City from which the U.S. moved its embassy in 2018&quot; is a modern clue, and one seemingly designed to either raise hackles or cause you to lovingly stroke your red MAGA cap. Is it ok to stoke political outrage in a crossword? Sure, why not? I love NOBAMA too, not because it echoes my sentiments, but because it&#39;s a lively clue tailor-made to evoke a reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baseball lingo clues carry a regionalism danger. Your local broadcaster may refer to a &quot;singleton,&quot; but it&#39;s tough to know if that&#39;s universal language or just how your play caller talks. Still, easy enough to figure out given a few letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RATE clue is a little geeky, which I like. NASAL CAVITY is a snotty answer. I didn&#39;t know EPIZOA. &quot;Little protestation&quot; is a terrific clue for PEEP. The 2007 film &quot;LARS and the Real Girl&quot; is delightful. Lars&#39;s companion Bianca, not exactly a real girl, is a sex doll. No, really, it&#39;s more charming than it sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wraps up another <em>Jeff and Jim Cross Words</em> week. If we get enough feedback, we might do this once a month or so.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Sunday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/7/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":true,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":21,"cols":21},"grid":["G","U","R","U","S",".",".","T","R","E","A","T","Y",".",".","S","E","P","T","E","T","E","P","I","Z","O","A",".","E","E","N","S","I","E",".","U","N","R","E","A","D","Y","R","S","A","I","L","S","P","L","I","T","T","E","R",".","T","O","N","E","D","U","P","M","E","L",".","O","C","T","A",".",".","O","U","T","Q","E","R","S","P","A","C","E","S","T","S",".","H","E","A","V","E","D",".","P","L","A","N","E","T",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","T","O","N",".","I","R","I","S",".","E","N","S",".",".","M","A","R","S","R","O","U","O","M","D","I","V","I","D","E","R",".","D","I","S","P","O","S","A","L","A","R","M","R","E","S","T",".",".","N","A","A","S","A","L","C","A","V","I","T","Y","T","A","P","I","R",".","S","E","A","T",".","I","T","S",".","U","N","E","A","S","E","E","L","S","E",".","S","O","R","T",".","R","N","A",".","F","B","I",".","N","O","R",".",".",".","S","E","C","U","R","R","I","T","Y","B","R","E","A","C","H",".",".",".","S","L","O",".","A","L","T",".","O","N","E",".","L","A","R","S",".","O","H","N","O","T","O","W","A","G","E",".","P","O","I",".","B","E","E","R",".","B","R","O","O","D","P","A","E","P","E","R","C","U","T","T","E","R",".",".","I","P","L","A","N","T","O","A","F","T","E","R","A","L","L",".","S","P","A","F","E","C","R","A","C","K","E","R","T","S","O","S",".",".","O","S","O",".","A","N","O","N",".","E","N","E",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","N","O","B","A","M","A",".","D","O","C","O","C","K",".","U","S","B","L","U","C","K","E","Y","B","R","E","A","K",".",".","O","V","E","N",".","N","E","E","O","N","L","E","A","V","E",".","G","R","A","N","G","D","O","P","E","N","I","N","G","A","D","O","P","T","E","R",".","A","G","L","A","R","E",".","T","S","E","T","S","E","D","O","G","T","O","Y",".",".","S","H","E","E","R","S",".",".","S","W","E","E","T"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,0,6,7,8,9,10,11,0,0,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,0,27,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,31,32,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,36,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,46,0,47,0,48,49,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,54,55,56,0,0,57,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,64,65,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,69,70,71,0,72,0,0,0,73,0,0,0,74,0,0,0,0,75,76,77,78,79,0,0,80,0,0,0,81,0,0,0,82,0,0,0,0,83,0,0,0,0,84,0,0,0,0,0,85,0,0,0,86,0,0,0,87,88,0,0,0,0,0,89,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,90,0,0,91,92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,93,0,0,0,0,0,94,0,95,0,96,0,0,0,0,97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,98,99,0,0,0,100,0,101,0,0,102,0,0,0,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,0,0,0,0,0,0,110,0,0,111,0,0,0,0,112,0,0,113,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,114,0,0,115,116,0,0,0,0,117,0,0,0,118,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,119,0,0,0,0,0,0,120,0,0,0,0,0,121,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,122,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,123,0,0,0,0],"circles":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
