Two clues cleverly separate normally-combined compound words. &quot;King maker&quot; (you expect to see kingmaker) and &quot;Honey bunch&quot;, (not honeybunch.) Those innocuous extra spaces point to SERTA and WORKER BEES. Brilliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Protector of the heart&quot; is a romantic clue for RIBCAGE; the image here was hand drawn by da Vinci. AND WE&#39;RE OFF might be my favorite 1-Across ever. &quot;Crux of &#39;The Crucible&#39;&quot; is fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One who&#39;s got game ... but shouldn&#39;t&quot; for POACHER is outstanding. That clue alone makes this puzzle memorable.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/5/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["A","N","D","W","E","R","E","O","F","F",".","S","I","T","E","P","E","R","I","W","I","N","K","L","E",".","E","T","A","L","S","T","A","L","E","B","R","E","A","D",".","T","O","N","Y","E","S","M","E",".","C","A","D","S",".","M","A","L","E","S",".",".",".",".","L","A","G",".","H","A","I","R","D","Y","E","S","T","O","W","A","G","E",".","M","O","N","E","Y",".",".","C","A","P","O","N","E",".","G","O","L","D","C","O","I","N","A","L","E","R","T",".","D","A","B",".","M","O","U","S","E","T","I","N","K","E","R","E","D",".","P","E","R","S","O","N",".",".","S","E","R","T","A",".","C","O","L","D","O","N","E","S","C","O","R","N","E","D",".","L","A","D",".",".",".",".","C","L","U","B","S",".","L","A","I","C",".","A","L","B","A","H","E","R","E",".","W","I","T","C","H","T","R","I","A","L","M","A","C","E",".","I","N","T","H","E","W","I","N","G","S","O","R","E","S",".","G","E","N","E","R","A","L","T","S","O"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,0,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,26,27,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,32,33,34,0,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,46,47,0,0,0,48,49,50,51,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
