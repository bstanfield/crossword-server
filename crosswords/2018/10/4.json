{"title":"NY Times, Thu, Oct 04, 2018","author":"Joon Pahk","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"10/4/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>We&#39;ve been conditioned to expect something radical on Thursday &mdash; words turning corners or going backward or busting out of the grid or, well, anything goes. So, we approach Thursdays with a combination of excitement and trepidation, knowing that things are unlikely to be as they appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It might pop out of a kids&#39; mouth&quot; turns out to be BUBBLE GUM. No obvious wordplay there, so our antennae go up. Something must be wrong, but let&#39;s go on. JUDAS PRIEST and GAS PIPES have straightforward clues too. Wow, this is going to be sneaky. &quot;Swinger&#39;s club&quot; is cute, but BASEBALL BAT comes to mind easily. Yikes, what are we missing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revealer, pointing to the ends of the other theme answers is SODA MIXER. Looking back, well, we have anagrams of SPRITE, PEPSI, COKE, and TAB. After the build-up (self-imposed, but not unreasonable) we have simple soft drink anagrams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only one left is UGM or GMU or, well, it must be MUG. Is there a MUG soda too? Perhaps it&#39;s a regional thing. A quick search pulls up MUG root beer which, while not a brand I&#39;ve encountered, is legitimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After whining earlier this week that complaining about the day of week that the puzzle runs on is dangerous, this doesn&#39;t feel like a Thursday theme. In the rest of the grid, there are some odd facts to uncover, but little wordplay. So, I don&#39;t know; it&#39;s a well-constructed puzzle. I was fooled because I wasn&#39;t fooled. That&#39;s a meta crossword for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feel free to publicly embarrass me if I&#39;m missing something here.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Thursday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/4/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["L","G","B","T",".","A","C","L","U",".","A","M","A","I","N","O","L","I","O",".","W","O","O","T",".","N","A","N","C","E","B","U","B","B","L","E","G","U","M",".","T","O","N","O","W","S","T","I","E","B",".",".",".","O","C","A","R","I","N","A",".",".",".",".","J","U","D","A","S","P","R","I","E","S","T","E","R","A","S",".","S","E","A","T","A","C",".",".",".",".","G","A","S","P","I","P","E","S",".",".","T","O","L","L","S","A","G","A","I","N","S","T",".","L","A","I","D","O","U","T","D","E","P","T","H",".",".","M","A","R","C","E","C","K","O",".",".",".",".","I","M","G","A","M","E",".","S","K","E","W","B","A","S","E","B","A","L","L","B","A","T",".",".",".",".","A","M","E","R","I","C","A",".",".",".","I","N","E","P","T","S","I","T","A","T",".","S","O","D","A","M","I","X","E","R","I","N","U","S","E",".","S","H","A","G",".","N","I","N","A","L","O","P","E","D",".","Y","O","L","O",".","E","T","S","Y"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,24,25,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,28,29,30,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,34,35,36,37,38,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,41,0,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,45,46,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,49,50,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,54,55,56,57,58,59,0,0,0,0,0,60,61,62,63,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
