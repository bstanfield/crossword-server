Old pros might become a little jaded, but I&#39;m sure they all remember their own debuts. It&#39;s a special thrill to get your first crossword published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite what some insist, IRONICAL isn&#39;t wrong; it&#39;s just old-fashioned. Modern writers prefer IRONIC, but crosswords aren&#39;t limited to what&#39;s currently in vogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday is Peak-Difficulty Day and, under Will Shortz, that tends to mean hard clues rather than hard words. There are plenty of ways to clue HEARTS AND MINDS, but to make it Saturday hard, we get a reference to a four-decade-old documentary. That sounds unfair, but even if you haven&#39;t seen that film recently, and you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s the kind of phrase that, given enough letters, makes enough sense to guess. This is how Saturday works. KNEECAP is a simple enough word, but you have to go back to your med school days to remember &quot;sesamoid bone.&quot; Or more likely, you ran across that somewhere, and it&#39;s still stuck in some corner of your brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Woman&#39;s name that rhymes with a part of the world&quot; is a tough clue because the various common parts of the world that rhyme with ERICA have different syllable counts, making the rhyme less obvious. Still, it&#39;s fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I often enjoy phrase answers like LABOR INTENSIVE and SLICED AND DICED. &quot;Now you&#39;re talking!&quot; is a perfect clue for THAT&#39;S THE SPIRIT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did &quot;Regurgitate, as a baby would&quot; make you throw up in your mouth a little? I&#39;m less squeamish than some solvers; it&#39;s hard to offend me, and particularly hard in a game. We do get email, though, from indignant solvers who disapprove of certain clues or answers, and I&#39;m sure NYT receives far more than we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like &quot;What isn&#39;t legal for copying&quot; for LTR, and I <em>love</em> &quot;R.E.M. show?&quot; for DREAM.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/6/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["O","F","F","E","D",".",".","S","A","H","L",".","S","Z","A","D","R","I","V","E","S",".","O","R","E","O","T","H","I","N","S","E","R","I","A","L",".","S","C","A","T","H","I","N","G",".","S","E","L","F","I","M","P","O","R","T","A","N","C","E","O","H","H","I",".","C","I","A",".","T","A","T","T","E","R","I","M","O","N",".","E","R","D","O","S",".","S","O","D","S","N","E","S","T","E","D",".","S","H","A","L","T",".",".",".","K","N","E","E","C","A","P",".","O","N","T","H","E","G","O",".",".",".","N","O","N","O","S",".","D","R","E","X","E","L","A","T","I","T",".","D","R","E","A","M",".","S","C","A","D","D","E","N","I","E","D",".","T","R","I",".","P","A","R","S","L","A","B","O","R","I","N","T","E","N","S","I","V","E",".","I","R","O","N","I","C","A","L",".","D","O","R","A","D","O","B","A","R","S","C","E","N","E",".","S","P","I","T","U","P","S","T","N",".","A","D","O","S",".",".","S","T","E","P","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,0,0,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,14,0,15,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,26,0,0,27,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,29,0,0,30,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,33,0,34,0,0,0,35,36,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,41,42,43,0,0,44,0,0,45,0,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,0,49,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
