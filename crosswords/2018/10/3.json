Look for the bright stars near Polaris forming a big W. It will immediately evoke an image of a beautiful Ethiopian queen chained to a throne. Or, at least it did to ancient Greeks. The fate of <span style=\"background-color:#f5f6f5\">Cassiopeia&#39;s</span> daughter was even harsher. Andromeda was tied naked to a sea-side rock, to be devoured by a sea monster.

That&#39;s what you want from a constructor. I appreciate outstanding word-crossing skill too but, he&#39;s right that, for early-week puzzles, a delightful theme will atone for a few duds in execution. This is a near-perfect theme, combining astronomy and mythology. Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone came out 21 years ago, but Greek myths are even older. Mark my words, they will withstand the test of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did THE NEREIDS feel like a cheat to you? The definite article was necessary for grid symmetry, but it made it harder to suss out the word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GUS Van Sant mostly directed smaller films like <em>My Own Private Idaho</em>, but his <em>Good Will Hunting</em> was a hit. MARX, sadly, gets a non-Groucho clue. &quot;Don&#39;t Cry for Me, Argentina&quot; is, indeed, from EVITA. Do those lyrics make any sense to you? Listen carefully the next time you hear that song and ask yourself what, if anything, they might mean.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=10/3/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["T","H","E","M",".","G","R","O","G",".","Y","A","C","H","T","I","O","T","A",".","E","A","V","E",".","A","G","R","E","E","D","A","H","L",".","T","H","E","N","E","R","E","I","D","S","E","X","I","L","E","D",".","R","E","N","D",".","S","G","T",".",".","O","S","L","O",".",".","S","O","L","A","C","E","S","G","A","P",".","K","N","E","W",".","K","I","L","O","S",".","U","N","I","X",".","E","X","A","M","I","N","E",".",".",".","S","N","A","R","F",".","I","D","A",".","E","X","P","A","T",".",".",".","A","U","S","T","E","R","E",".","A","O","N","E",".","B","R","Y","C","E",".","S","X","S","W",".","S","O","N","L","E","A","S","H","E","D",".",".","T","O","T","E",".",".","A","H","I",".","S","T","E","M",".","U","N","R","I","P","E","C","A","S","S","I","O","P","E","I","A",".","I","D","O","L","E","V","I","T","A",".","O","M","A","R",".","C","O","P","S","S","E","N","D","S",".","T","O","N","Y",".","K","N","E","E"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,26,0,0,0,27,28,0,0,29,0,30,31,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,34,0,35,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,39,0,0,0,40,0,41,42,43,0,0,0,44,0,45,0,0,0,46,0,47,0,0,0,0,48,49,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,51,0,52,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,55,0,56,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,58,0,0,59,0,60,0,0,0,61,62,63,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,66,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,70,0,0,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,72,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
