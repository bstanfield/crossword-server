Like most portmanteau words, it&#39;s odd at first but easy to figure out. Smartphones are getting bigger, tablets shrink, and eventually, they overlap into a new device category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tube tops&quot; and &quot;Case load&quot; are clever. I like the green juice provider too. &quot;What ... may represent&quot; is a fun, modern clue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the theme answers, here&#39;s why I&#39;m disappointed. I&#39;d love to end our Argument Week with bitter disagreement, but I&#39;m afraid I concur with Jeff. They&#39;re all outstanding. Well, I love OREGON TRANSPLANT just as much as the others, but that&#39;s the extent of my divergence. Bravo, Joel Fagliano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wraps up our <em>Jim and Jeff at the </em><em>Puzzles</em> experiment.
