When we get a Thursday without gimmicks, are we, then, fooled? No need to contemplate this deep philosophy because today we get the standard ins and outs of a regular rebus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001319/\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTU3OTU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODg2NDE1._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:250px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:168px\" title=\"Mark Harmon\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=*IN*OUT*\">hundreds of possible entries that include IN somewhere followed by OUT somewhere</a>, but if you restrict your search to entries where IN doesn&#39;t mean &quot;in&quot; and OUT doesn&#39;t mean &quot;out&quot; (not possible with our software; you need to do this by hand, I mean eye) you end up with a much smaller set. The non-revealer theme entries today all pass that test. Ponce de Le&oacute;n gave the trick away, so I wish it had appeared further down, but the puzzle was still fun. IN BOX and OUT BOX are solid rebus justifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t know about KEFIR. Does the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir\">Wikipedia</a> comment that &quot;Fermentation of the lactose yields a sour, carbonated, slightly alcoholic beverage, with a consistency and taste similar to thin yogurt&quot; make you more, or less, intrigued?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=11/22/2011&amp;g=63&amp;d=A\">YOU AGAIN</a> first appeared in 2011 with a more positive clue: &quot;Well, look who&#39;s back.&quot; I like today&#39;s snarkier &quot;Question to a returning pest.&quot; AFRO tip-toes around controversy by giving it a music clue. RAINBOW TROUT is delicious. I&#39;ve lived in America for years, but I still find the LITER spelling jarring. LXX is a cheap entry, but IN BOX stacked over OUT BOX makes it well worthwhile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s see what Jeff has to say. In my experience, if you give him three barleycorns, he&#39;ll take 1.60934 kilometres.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Thursday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/13/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["Q","U","I","Z",".",".","A","M","A","Z","E",".","C","C","S","E","T","R","E",".",".","K","E","F","I","R",".","H","U","T","D","E","K","E","D",".","C","A","R","P","IN","G","A","B","OUT",".",".",".","S","O","Y",".","N","O","S",".","U","R","S","I","A","S","K",".","J","O","E","S",".",".",".","L","L","C","S","T","H","E","F","O","U","N","T","A","IN","O","F","Y","OUT","H","M","I","M","E",".","A","B","O","R","T","S",".",".",".",".",".","V","O","Y","A","G","E",".","G","E","T","U","P","S",".",".",".",".",".","H","A","R","M","O","N",".","S","U","N","S","F","R","O","T","H","IN","G","A","T","T","H","E","M","OUT","H","L","E","N","O",".",".",".","I","S","L","E",".","P","S","Y","A","H","E","M",".","T","E","T",".","Y","E","T",".",".",".","R","A","IN","B","O","W","T","R","OUT",".","S","H","E","L","L","E","S","C",".","L","I","T","E","R",".",".","IN","B","O","X","S","H","H",".","E","X","U","D","E",".",".","OUT","B","O","X"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,0,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,16,0,0,0,17,0,18,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,21,0,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,25,26,0,27,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,30,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,33,34,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,40,41,42,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,46,47,48,49,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,56,57,0,0,58,0,59,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,62,0,63,0,64,65,66,67,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,70,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,0,0,72,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
