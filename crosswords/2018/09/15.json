{"title":"NY Times, Sat, Sep 15, 2018","author":"David Liben-Nowell","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"9/15/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>How much I love a Saturday crossword depends on a couple of factors largely outside the control of the constructor or editor. The first criterion is whether I can finish, chiefly affected by the overlap of things the puzzle thinks are worth knowing and things I happen to know. The second is how amused I am by the clues, which says more about my sense of humor than anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Ohio_State_Football_Team_1890.jpg\" style=\"border:none\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Ohio_State_Football_Team_1890.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid gray; float:right; height:176px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px\" title=\"Love those uniforms\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes today&#39;s puzzles satisfying (so, yes, I finished and with an amused smile) is that several common words get nicely diverting clues that at first seem impossible but nicely click into place. I know nothing about college football in 1890, but with a couple of letters in place, &quot;Something STATE&quot; seemed likely, leaving four letters to fill in. Utah or Iowa feels less probable than OHIO. I know little about Islam, but the first letter J pointed right away to JERUSALEM. I speak no Farsi, but STAN seems obvious. I don&#39;t play Risk, but SIAM fell easily. That&#39;s three fun facts I learned from one puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SELF-DRIVING CARS is a topical entry. &quot;M&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; is an impressive clue for MOVIE. The Edison clues are fun. Senate coverage isn&#39;t DOME at all, but TOGA. ASPS are cousins of garter snakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The equation x + 0 = x is indeed an AXIOM. Mathematics (also science, technology, etc.) depends on accepting such things on faith. If one of the famed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms\">Peano axioms</a> is found to be untrue, your iPhone will suddenly stop working. If you have a Galaxy, it will catch fire.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/15/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["C","A","M","P","U","S","M","A","P",".","P","A","S","T","A","O","H","I","O","S","T","A","T","E",".","A","X","I","O","M","S","A","M","E","S","E","X","M","A","R","R","I","A","G","E","A","B","E",".","T","A","E",".","R","A","I","N","M","A","N",".",".","O","R","E","L","S","E",".","G","A","G",".",".",".","R","O","G","U","E","S",".","Y","E","O","H",".","C","E","O","A","P","R","I","L",".","J","E","R","U","S","A","L","E","M","S","T","A","N",".","S","P","L","I","T",".","G","E","R","E","P","I","P","S","Q","U","E","A","K",".","A","G","A","I","N","S","C","H",".","R","I","G","S",".","O","V","I","N","E","S",".",".",".","O","C","T",".","H","I","R","E","E","S",".",".","I","M","A","F","O","O","L",".","N","A","N",".","L","G","A","S","E","L","F","D","R","I","V","I","N","G","C","A","R","S","M","O","V","I","E",".","F","I","N","G","E","R","T","I","P","S","W","A","T","S",".","T","A","K","E","S","T","E","P","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,23,0,0,0,24,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,26,27,0,0,0,0,0,28,29,0,0,0,30,31,32,33,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,49,50,0,0,0,51,0,52,0,0,0,53,54,55,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,58,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
