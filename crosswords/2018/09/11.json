{"title":"NY Times, Tue, Sep 11, 2018","author":"Timothy Polin","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"9/11/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p><em>Jim and Jeff at the </em><em>Puzzles</em> continues all this week, and today, I get to go first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One staple of comedy is the character who takes metaphorical phrases literally; think of Hymie the Robot in<em> </em><em>Get</em><em> Smart</em>. It&#39;s also a rich source of crossword themes. Today, FLOWERY LANGUAGE is, literally, phrases with flowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.tmz.com/2017/11/08/1108-tyrese-gibson-profile-200x250.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:200px\" title=\"Tyrese Gibson\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I haven&#39;t talked with Jeff Chen about this puzzle, but I can anticipate his objection. Two theme entries are noun phrases, one is a verb phrase, and one is a comparative expression. One and only one is an actual flower, as well as an epithet. Purists like more consistency than that. If the theme phrases are fun, I&#39;m happy leaving the hobgoblins chained in the basement. Don&#39;t feed them. You&#39;ll enjoy life more without them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2oIbZoQ\">WOE IS I</a> is a fun title for a surprisingly entertaining and useful book. I don&#39;t often see GAWP outside of crosswords. OXYMORON gets a straightforward clue, but &quot;original copy&quot; and &quot;open secret&quot; are amusing examples. &quot;Ambulances&#39; hosp. destinations&quot; struck me as an odd clue for ERS since Emergency Rooms aren&#39;t typically the destinations for the ambulances themselves, but I get the idea. With an entry as<a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Finder?word=ERS\"> common and as awkward as ERS</a>, it&#39;s tough to plow new ground, especially for an early-week puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENGLISH ROSE was considered quite a compliment when, say, my grandmother used it. I suspect it&#39;s now mostly used ironically. Maybe it&#39;s time to resurrect more flowery language.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Tuesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/11/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["M","E","T","A","D","A","T","A",".","D","E","F","A","N","G","O","X","Y","M","O","R","O","N",".","I","L","L","S","E","E","S","H","R","I","N","K","I","N","G","V","I","O","L","E","T","H","O","E","D",".",".",".","A","R","E","S","O",".",".",".","E","R","S",".","E","N","G","L","I","S","H","R","O","S","E","S","T","E","L","L","A","R",".","P","T","A",".","O","L","D",".",".",".","A","L","I","A","S",".",".",".","S","N","U","G","F","L","O","W","E","R","Y","L","A","N","G","U","A","G","E","L","O","P","S",".",".",".","O","C","E","A","N",".",".",".","A","K","A",".","A","T","M",".","T","A","R","G","E","T","S","G","I","L","D","T","H","E","L","I","L","Y",".","L","E","A",".",".",".","O","B","E","S","E",".",".",".","G","N","A","T","A","S","F","R","E","S","H","A","S","A","D","A","I","S","Y","W","O","E","I","S","I",".","D","O","G","O","W","N","E","R","E","L","E","C","T","S",".","S","T","E","W","P","O","T","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,22,23,24,0,0,0,0,0,25,26,27,28,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,35,36,37,0,0,0,0,0,38,39,40,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,44,45,46,0,47,0,0,0,48,49,50,51,0,0,52,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,57,58,59,0,0,0,0,0,60,61,62,0,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
