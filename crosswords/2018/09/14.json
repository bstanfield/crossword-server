{"title":"NY Times, Fri, Sep 14, 2018","author":"John Guzzetta","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"9/14/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>In 2010, I wrote an article for the Science section of the New York Times called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/science/07moment.html\">The Rush of the &lsquo;Crossword Puzzle Moment.&#39;</a> I contended that we all have all keep information at the edge of our consciousness, things we don&#39;t know that we know. Part of the joy of crosswords is that tiny clues, sometimes just one or two letters from crossing words, can unlock these facts, and unlocking them can be very satisfying. That happened to me today with DANGER MOUSE. I have no idea what their music is like, but somehow, even though I&#39;m not tuned in to it, I know that Danger Mouse is a thing and that it had to fit the clue. Endorphins are a great drug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, how could you not have fallen in love with Sarah KOENIG? Like everyone in America except, apparently, Jeff, I followed the weekly podcast drops of <em>Serial</em> with great anticipation. <a href=\"https://serialpodcast.org/\">Season 3 begins September 20th</a>. I&#39;ll be there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And SHTETL? Have you never seen Fiddler on the Roof? Talking crosswords with Jeff is a constant reminder that different life experiences lead to different crossword experiences. How audacious of this rectangular art form to take as its ambit of allowable topics, everything worth knowing! Personally, I haven&#39;t known everything since I was in my mid-teens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I liked the science clue for WAVELENGTHS but it didn&#39;t feel quite right, implying subtraction was somehow involved. &quot;Color determinants&quot; would have made me feel better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff <em>is</em> right about the clues for HAS BEENS and BARBS. Outstanding.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/14/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["W","A","V","E","L","E","N","G","T","H","S",".","A","R","P","I","M","A","G","I","N","E","T","H","A","T",".","B","O","A","D","A","N","G","E","R","M","O","U","S","E",".","O","T","S","E","S","S",".","W","O","E","S",".","B","E","A","V","I","S",".",".",".","F","I","L","A",".","T","E","R","S","E","S","T","S","H","T","E","T","L",".","S","H","E","E","P","I","S","H","W","O","R","T","H",".","F","O","U","N","D",".","T","E","E","I","N","I","T",".","B","E","A","D","S",".","B","A","R","B","S","E","P",".","L","A","M","P","S",".","D","E","L","I","A","S","Y","L","L","A","B","U","S",".","K","E","L","L","E","R","C","H","E","A","T","E","R",".","B","O","I","L",".",".",".","H","O","T","T","E","R",".","S","E","E","R",".","D","A","X","A","N","I",".","H","U","N","T","A","N","D","P","E","C","K","R","E","M",".","I","T","S","A","M","I","R","A","C","L","E","D","Y","E",".","T","H","A","T","S","G","E","N","I","U","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,0,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,21,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,26,27,0,0,0,0,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,0,38,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,45,46,47,48,0,0,0,49,0,50,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
