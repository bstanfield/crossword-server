Like the other circled words, it&#39;s a kind of cheese. One might as well complain that some of the cheeses here are from cow milk, but others are from sheep milk. (FETA can, apparently, even include goat milk.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the BURL IVES clue but, Jeff is right, it&#39;s less satisfying if you don&#39;t know the man. He was a popular folksy singer in his day with a gentle, engaging voice. The &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; reference elevates the entry. When you think of that iconic film, you probably flash to Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman. It takes a few seconds to remember that, oh yeah, Burl Ives played Big Daddy. &quot;There ain&#39;t nothin&#39; more powerful than the odor of mendacity!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Stulberg is right about 10-Down. &quot;Grp. making after-work plans?&quot; for AARP is sublime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m looking forward to arguing with Jeff this week. Well, we always argue, but this week we&#39;ll do it in public. Let&#39;s see if we&#39;re still friends after seven days. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve written regularly about crosswords.
