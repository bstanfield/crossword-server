Suppose you&#39;re responsible for 365 daily puzzles a year, not just to edit, but to select. How do you choose? Crosswords that rely only on wide-spread knowledge become tedious. Ones that target specialized knowledge risk turning off as many solvers as they please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you speak French (being Canadian helps sometimes!) and you love to eat, today&#39;s puzzle is a delight. I quickly entered theme answers, all the while realizing that if Mr. Wechsler had targeted literal meanings of, say, Mexican food, my experience would have been less satisfying. Is this fair? Is fair even relevant? We sometimes see puzzles that rely on intimate knowledge of Manhattan geography, Sondheim musicals, or professional tennis. Me? I&#39;m still waiting for a grid with all eight of Br&uuml;nnhilde&#39;s Valkyrie sisters from <em>The Ring</em>. (How do you spell Ro&szlig;wei&szlig;e again?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I agree with Jeff that crossing SHINZO with TZE is rough, especially since those are both transliterations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;CRY havoc and let slip the dogs of war&quot; is just one of many great lines Mark Antony gets. Trust me; that Shakespeare guy is going to be a household name.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Wednesday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=9/12/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["A","S","H","E",".","P","A","P","A",".","B","E","G","A","T","S","H","U","N",".","E","Y","E","S","O","F","B","L","U","E","W","I","N","D",".","P","E","T","I","T","F","O","U","R","S","I","N","G","O","T",".",".","E","M","T",".","N","E","A","T","T","Z","E",".","A","D","D",".","O","E","D",".","S","L","Y","H","O","R","S","D","O","E","U","V","R","E","S",".",".",".",".","A","F","T",".","L","A","S",".",".","M","U","I","R",".",".","B","O","U","I","L","L","A","B","A","I","S","S","E",".",".","E","R","R","S",".",".","G","U","V",".","H","O","C",".",".",".",".","M","I","L","L","E","F","E","U","I","L","L","E","T","L","C",".","S","A","O",".","F","O","G",".","A","A","A","A","E","R","O",".","T","W","O",".",".","G","E","T","I","T","F","R","E","N","C","H","C","H","E","F",".","D","I","M","E","T","O","W","E","R","S","U","I","T","E",".","D","O","E","R","S","I","S","S","Y",".","T","O","A","D",".","A","N","D","Y"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,0,9,10,11,12,13,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,21,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,25,26,0,27,0,28,0,29,0,0,30,0,0,31,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,37,38,0,0,39,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,47,48,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,50,51,52,53,0,54,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,56,0,0,57,0,0,58,0,59,0,60,0,0,61,62,0,0,0,63,0,0,0,64,0,0,0,65,66,0,67,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,70,0,0,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,72,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
