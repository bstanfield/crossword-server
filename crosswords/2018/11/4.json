{"title":"UNTHEMED","author":"Patrick Berry","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2018, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"11/4/2018","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>What&#39;s this? A Sunday puzzle with the clearly deceptive title, &quot;Unthemed&quot;? You&#39;re not going to fool me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA2NjY5OTkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2NTkxNA@@._V1_.jpg\" style=\"border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0 6px 12px; width:167px\" title=\"Katie Holmes\" />And yet, that grid looks unusual for a Sunday. It has <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?select=fewest21\">fewer blocks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/Open/Sunday\">more open squares</a> <em>by far</em> than any NYT Sunday crossword ever. Could it actually be unthemed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why yes it is, and that makes it a rare treat. Themes are fun &mdash; they let you uncover hidden connections between answers, and they often help you solve the puzzle &mdash; but they have a downside. All that thematic material constrains the grid, forcing the rest of the answers to work around inconvenient letters in awkward locations. Then people like Jeff complain that &quot;the fill&quot; is suboptimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Themeless puzzles don&#39;t have that excuse, but then they have to deliver with great answers and clever clues. It takes a constructor with special skills to pull that off in a big Sunday grid. Patrick Berry has special skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love this puzzle, and I hope it starts a trend. I wouldn&#39;t want this every Sunday, but now and then would be appreciated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, we get great clues right from 1-Across. ARE WE DONE HERE is an evocative phrase. &quot;Shade in the woods&quot; is a terrific clue for FOREST GREEN. It goes on and on. Even the odd ars MAGNA, Latin for &quot;great art,&quot; gets a fair clue with the anagram hint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff and I have decided to do &quot;Jeff and Jim Cross Words&quot; only on puzzles where we disagree, and he doesn&#39;t share my enthusiasm today. Let&#39;s see what he has to say.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Sunday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=11/4/2018","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":true,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":21,"cols":21},"grid":["B","O","B","S","F","O","R","A","P","P","L","E","S",".","M","I","D","R","I","F","F","A","R","E","W","E","D","O","N","E","H","E","R","E",".","O","C","E","A","N","I","A","W","I","R","E","R","E","C","O","R","D","E","R","S",".","T","O","E","T","A","G","S","L","O","R","E","N",".","K","I","S","S",".","O","S","M","O","N","D",".","S","E","T","S","N","A","P",".","B","O","N","E",".","B","R","I","A","R","S",".","H","E","A","D",".",".",".",".","P","O","U","T",".","B","E","F","O","G","S",".","F","A","N","T","A","D","E","S","C","E","N","T",".","L","E","A","R","N","S",".","D","O","R","S","E","Y","I","N","T","O","T","O",".","H","A","L","V","E","S",".","P","O","R","T","E","R","S","T","R","A","P","S",".","B","O","W","T","I","E",".","M","E","M","E",".",".",".",".","K","A","T","I","E","H","O","L","M","E","S",".","P","A","R","A","S","A","I","L",".","O","P","E","N","M","I","N","D","E","D",".","B","A","R","M","I","T","Z","V","A","H",".","T","D","G","A","R","D","E","N",".","M","A","S","K","I","N","G","T","A","P","E",".",".",".",".","T","E","E","M",".","C","O","R","S","E","T",".","R","E","N","T","S","R","I","C","H","A","R","D",".","S","O","R","B","E","T",".","G","E","C","K","O","S","A","M","O","U","R","S",".","F","O","U","L","E","D",".","G","O","E","S","A","P","E","D","I","R","T","Y",".","A","L","F","R","E","D",".","B","R","A","N",".",".",".",".","I","N","N","S",".","P","R","E","T","T","Y",".","M","O","O","T",".","S","C","A","B","O","L","E",".","S","E","N","A","T","E",".","V","A","T","S",".","C","L","O","S","E","C","O","L","G","A","T","E",".","A","S","B","I","G","A","S","A","H","O","U","S","E","A","V","I","A","T","E","S",".","C","A","Y","E","N","N","E","P","E","P","P","E","R","R","E","A","P","E","R","S",".","O","N","E","W","A","Y","S","T","R","E","E","T","S"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,0,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,0,27,0,28,0,0,0,0,29,0,0,30,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,38,39,40,0,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,52,53,54,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,61,0,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,63,64,65,66,0,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0,0,0,69,0,0,0,0,0,0,70,0,0,0,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,0,0,72,0,0,0,0,0,73,0,0,0,0,0,0,74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,75,0,0,0,0,76,0,0,0,0,0,0,77,0,0,0,0,78,79,80,81,82,0,0,0,83,0,0,0,0,0,0,84,0,0,0,0,85,0,0,0,0,86,0,0,87,0,0,0,0,88,0,89,0,0,0,0,90,0,0,0,0,0,91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
