I spent many hours there as young electronics experimenter picking out just the right diodes and capacitors. (You kids nowadays with your fancy-dancy <em>integrated circuits</em> have no idea what you&#39;re missing!) So right away I&#39;m hooked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I hit SALOME. As much as I love Puccini and Wagner, Salome is probably my favorite opera. I love every note. It jumps right into the story without any prologue, and it finishes the whole sordid tale in a single act. The plot, from a play by Oscar Wilde, is well known. Herod pleads with Salome to dance for him. She complies with the infamous Dance of the Seven Veils. Herod is so delighted that he offers to grant Salome anything she wishes. Her recent attempts to seduce John the Baptist had failed, so she asks for John&#39;s head on a platter. Seems a bit much, but a promise is a promise. The opera ends when Salome kisses the decapitated John on the lips.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Friday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=11/26/2021","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["P","E","S","T",".","R","A","D","I","O","S","H","A","C","K","A","R","I","A",".","I","R","O","N","M","A","I","D","E","N","T","R","A","P",".","D","E","N","T","A","L","C","A","R","E","H","O","M","E","R",".","S","T","E","N","O",".","M","A","W",".","R","E","S","I","N",".","B","R","I","M",".",".",".",".","O","P","S",".","C","U","B","E",".","S","E","M","P","L","E","F","R","E","S","H","M","E","A","T",".",".","A","R","E","A","F","O","C","I",".","B","E","S","O","T",".","D","O","G","S","A","N","A","T",".",".","S","T","R","I","K","E","P","A","Y","L","E","T","H","A","L",".","R","O","L","E",".","A","L","A",".",".",".",".","B","A","B","A",".","L","E","T","G","O",".","D","N","A",".","I","V","A","N","S",".","P","R","A","W","N","R","O","U","N","D","I","N","G","U","P",".","A","N","N","E","O","N","T","H","E","S","C","E","N","T",".","I","D","E","A","P","O","O","L","S","H","A","R","K","S",".","T","A","R","T"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,0,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,24,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,27,0,28,0,0,29,0,30,31,32,33,34,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,40,0,41,0,0,0,42,0,0,0,0,0,43,0,0,0,44,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,0,46,47,0,48,0,0,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,51,0,0,52,0,53,0,0,0,54,55,56,0,57,0,0,0,58,0,59,0,0,0,60,61,0,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,63,0,64,0,0,0,65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,0,0,0,67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,68,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
