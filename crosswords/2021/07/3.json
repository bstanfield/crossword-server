{"title":"NY Times, Sat, Jul 03, 2021","author":"Kameron Austin Collins","editor":"Will Shortz","copyright":"2021, The New York Times","publisher":"The New York Times","date":"7/3/2021","notepad":null,"jnotes":"<p>Did you like seeing ROY COHN in the grid?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are different schools of thought about what entries are suitable for crosswords, ranging from &quot;include nothing that makes me sad or might trigger anyone anywhere&quot; to &quot;anything in the newspaper itself is fair game.&quot; I tend toward the latter, but I understand the former.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crosswords have been criticized for including words that might be used as an insult in other contexts, under-representing various groups, etc., but controversial names seem to be especially tricky. There&#39;s an implication that grid inclusion implies endorsement. If you saw your own name in an NYT crossword, you&#39;d feel honored. I get that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crosswords would look much different if they completely eschewed the despicable and the evil. MAO and IDI are grid staples. IVANKA is a great combination of letters that will attract ambitious constructors. WAGNER and PICASSO and JFK and MLK are more famous for their work than for their moral failings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we learn more about the rich and famous, our opinion evolves. GIULIANI used to be an American Hero. Now he&#39;s a national embarrassment. WOODY ALLEN used to be an admired filmmaker. Now he&#39;s too toxic to include in a puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, I loved seeing Roy Cohn today, in the same way I enjoy seeing BILLY THE KID. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have my own triggers. ENOLA has been clued over 200 times in reference to that infamous B-29 bomber. Whatever you think of the military strategy behind the decision to bomb Japanese civilians, 70,000 deaths is a tragedy. Would JACK THE RIPPER be better because it was longer ago and fewer people died? Is that worse or not as bad as a lawyer who corrupted American democracy? Those are crazy calculations to try to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>[Added note]</strong> Reader Mike Knobler makes this astute observation: &quot;For some of us, seeing a name or an organization or an institution in the puzzle isn&#39;t offensive if the bad thing the person or organization or institution did or does is addressed in the clue. ROY COHN clued as a McCarthyite is much less offensive than, say, Henry Kissinger clued as a diplomat or the NRA clued as an advocacy group.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That makes sense to me. even though It doesn&#39;t completely solve the problem of you and I disagreeing on who is despicable and who is heroic.</p>","shadecircles":null,"interpretcolors":null,"key":null,"hold":null,"track":null,"autowrap":null,"mini":null,"id":null,"id2":null,"code":null,"dow":"Saturday","type":null,"target":"/Crossword?date=7/3/2021","valid":true,"uniclue":false,"admin":false,"hastitle":false,"navigate":true,"auto":false,"size":{"rows":15,"cols":15},"grid":["S","O","R","E","B","A","C","K",".",".",".","N","S","F","W","O","M","E","L","E","T","T","E",".",".","E","P","P","I","E","G","I","V","E","A","T","R","Y",".","M","A","R","I","S","T","S","T","E","N","C","I","L",".","H","A","T",".","T","A","N",".","S","T","A","H","L",".","T","O","K","E",".","I","C","U",".",".",".",".","H","A","M","O","P","E","R","A","T","O","R",".","T","H","O","U",".","A","H","E","M",".","N","O","U","S","C","R","E","A","T","U","R","E","F","E","A","T","U","R","E","A","I","N","T",".","S","I","L","O",".","L","I","T","T",".","M","A","S","S","G","E","N","E","R","A","L",".",".",".",".","B","L","T",".","O","R","E","N",".","D","E","E","T","S",".","O","R","E",".","F","I","R",".","R","O","Y","C","O","H","N","D","U","E","L","E","D",".","Z","I","R","C","O","N","I","A","I","N","T","E","R",".",".","I","D","E","A","L","I","S","M","A","S","H","E",".",".",".","P","A","S","T","I","C","H","E"],"gridnums":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,0,0,9,10,11,12,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,0,0,0,19,0,0,0,20,0,0,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,24,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,26,27,28,0,0,29,0,0,0,0,30,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,34,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,0,0,36,0,0,0,0,37,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,0,39,0,0,0,0,0,40,0,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,42,0,43,44,45,0,46,0,0,0,47,0,0,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,49,50,0,0,51,0,0,0,52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"circles":null,"acrossmap":null,"downmap":null,"rbars":null,"bbars":null,"clues":{"across":["1.
